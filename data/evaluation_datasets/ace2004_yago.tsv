look

perhaps
hear

after
that

decide
if
there
are
any
ballots

It
might
take

According

the
Lebanese

contacted
the

asked
it
to
put
an
end
to
infringements
by
Israel

which

in

dumping

that
if

then
such
acts
constitute
a
provocation

an
infringement
of
Lebanese
sovereignty
.
Witnesses
said
two

started
work
today
Tuesday
on
a
slope
in
the
Abbad
sector

on
the

equipped

ultra-modern
binoculars
penetrated
a
few
meters
into
Lebanese
territory

withdrew
back

the
burial
site
of
Sheikh
Abbad
,
who
died
500
years

,
is
located
.
For
their

Israelis
also
regard
the
site
as
a
shrine

according
to
them
,
Rabbi
Ashi
lived
there
in

in

``
successful

said
that
the

Tehran
is
embroiled
in
strategic
terrorist
activities
targeting
Israel
,
especially
alongside
Palestinian
and
Lebanese
organizations
.
''
The
official
further
considered
that
``
the
Shahab
missile
will
not
come
into

for
two
years
and
that
an
improved
range
of
2000
kilometers
would
only
be
achieved
after
this
period
.

would
``
know
how

with
a
1300
kilometer
range
.
Sneh
said
on

radio
that
``
Israel
will
prepare
itself
to
find
a
suitable

and
American
nuclear
capability
to

nuclear
heads
does
not
include
``
many

elements

''
The
official
who
wished
to
remain
anonymous
confirmed
``
we
have
paid
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
President
Putin

announcement

it

.
The
presidents
met
for
a
working
lunch
of
around
75
minutes
.
The
American
official
stressed
that
what
is
important
in
Putin
's
proposal
is
that
it
falls
within
the
``
framework
adopted
by
the
United
States
and
Russia
to
discuss
strategic
issues
from
a
defensive
and
offensive
point
of
view

''
Putin
proposed
limiting
the
Russian
and
American
nuclear
capabilities
by
reducing
the
number
of
nuclear
heads
to
under
1500
each
,
a
smaller
number
than
that
in
the
Russian-American
Start-3
treaty
currently
being
negotiated
.
He
proposed
that
the
current
reduction
should
be
between
2500
to
2000
nuclear
heads
.
Putin
said
this
reduction
would
depend
on
compliance
with
the
Russian-American
anti-ABM
missile
treaty
signed
in
1972
,
which
the
Americans
are
attempting
to
amend
to
set
up
anti-
missile
defenses

NMD

Washington

For
most
of
this
year
,
Asia	B	Asia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia
's
economies
have
performed
a
sort
of
levitating
act
_
growing
by
double-digit
rates
month
after
month
even
as
economists
predicted
they
would
fall
to
earth
.
That
dichotomy
was
on
vivid
display
here
Friday
:
Hong
Kong
reported
that
its
economic
output
surged
10.4
percent
in
the
third
quarter
,
and
it
raised
its
projection
for
full-year
growth
to
10
percent
from
8.5
percent
.
Yet
a
block
away
,
the
International	B	International_Monetary_Fund	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund
Monetary	I	International_Monetary_Fund	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund
Fund	I	International_Monetary_Fund	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund
warned
in
a
news
conference
that
Asian
economies
could
be
hit
hard
by
soaring
oil
prices
and
turmoil
in
the
financial
markets
.
The
IMF
said
a
$
5
increase
in
the
price
of
a
barrel
of
oil
could
slow
the
growth
rates
of
Asian
countries
next
year
.
``
The
prospects
for
growth
in
2001
have
weakened
,
''
said
David
Robinson
,
assistant
director
of
research
at
the
fund
.
``
There
has
also
been
increased
political
instability
across
the
world
,
not
least
in
Asia
.
''
Several
Asian
countries
_
notably
the
Philippines	B	Philippines	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines
,
Taiwan	B	Taiwan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan
,
and
Indonesia	B	Indonesia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia
_
have
been
gripped
by
political
tumult
in
recent
weeks
.
The
Philippines
president

Joseph

,
was
impeached
last

,
while

,
the

is
trying
to
fend
off
a

.
Even
in

and
South	B	South_Korea	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea
Korea	I	South_Korea	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea
,
Robinson
said
the
Fund
was
concerned
by
the
haphazard
pace
of
economic
reforms
.
In
many
countries
,
the
banks
and
corporations
remain
financially
shaky
.
``
We
're
still
seeing
chaebols
in
deep
trouble
,
''
he
said
,
referring
to
Korea
's
heavily
indebted
conglomerates
.
But
Robinson
acknowledged
that
these
weaknesses
had
not
yet
been
reflected
in
the
economic
performance
of
the
countries
.
On
Tuesday
,
South
Korea
reported
a
9.2
percent
increase
in
its
third-quarter
output
_
beating
the
estimates
of
most
analysts
and
extending
a
string
of
powerful
quarters
.
Indonesia
,
Malaysia
,
and
Singapore	B	Singapore	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore
have
also
beaten
expectations
,
while
Hong
Kong
's
growth
rate
was
nearly
three
percentage
points
above
a
median
forecast
of
12
economists
surveyed
by
Bloomberg	B	Bloomberg_News	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News
News	I	Bloomberg_News	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News
.
Like
other
Asian
economies
,
Hong
Kong
has
been
buoyed
by
an
unquenchable
appetite
for
its
exports
,
principally
in
the
United	B	United_States	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States
States	I	United_States	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States
.
Exports
surged
17.7
percent
in
the
third
quarter
.
Hong
Kong
has
done
a
particularly
booming
business
in
repackaging
and
shipping
goods
from
mainland
China	B	China	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China
.
Consumer
spending
rose
by
a
much
less
impressive
5.6
percent
,
as
retail
sales
slackened
from
the
second
quarter
.
And
consumer
prices
fell
2
percent
,
extending
a
decline
that
began
during
the
crisis
.
Ian
Perkin
,
chief
economist
at
the
Hong	B	Hong_Kong_General_Chamber_of_Commerce	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_General_Chamber_of_Commerce
Kong	I	Hong_Kong_General_Chamber_of_Commerce	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_General_Chamber_of_Commerce

Commerce	I	Hong_Kong_General_Chamber_of_Commerce	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_General_Chamber_of_Commerce
said
the
double-digit
growth
in
Hong
Kong
and
other
Asian
countries
masked
their
underlying
condition
.
While
the
region
's
growth
in
exports
has
been
torrid
,
domestic
demand
has
remained
tenuous
.
``
We
have
n't
built
up
our
domestic
economies
yet
,
''
he
said
.
``
The
recovery
has
relied
almost
completely
on
export
growth
.
``
If
consumer
spending
slows
down
in
the
States
,
it
will
have
a
devastating
effect
on
Asia
,
''
said
Perkin
.
``
2001
could
be
a
crunch
year
.
''
Robinson
of
the
IMF
was
similarly
wary
about
next
year
.
In
October
,
the
IMF
projected
that
the
world
economy
would
grow
4.2
percent
in
2001
,
while
Asia
as
a
region
would
grow
6.6
percent
.
On
Friday
,
Robinson
said
the
growth
rate
could
be
lower
,
though
he
would
not
say
by
how
much
.
A
principal
culprit
of
possibly
slower
growth
is
the
dependence
of
many
Asian
countries
on
imported
oil
.
Oil
prices
have
risen
$
5
per
barrel
since
the
IMF
issued
its
semi-annual
economic
outlook
in
October
.
Asia
has
little
control
over
oil
,
but
Robinson
said
the
region
could
improve
its
economic
prospects
by
calming
its
political
waters
.
One
bright
spot
in
the
Asian
landscape
is
China
,
which
is
on
track
to
record
8
percent
growth
in
2000
.
Robinson
said
the
main
question
facing
Chinese
leaders
was
whether
they
need
to
spend
billions
of
dollars
in
public
funds
to
further
stimulate
an
economy
that
was
already
expanding
.
Like
Perkin
,
Robinson
said
Asia
's
future
depended
in
large
part
on
the
health
of
the
United
States
.
But
he
disputed
those
who
predict
dramatically
slowing
growth
_
the
so-called
hard
landing
_
for
the
American
economy
.
``
The
chances
of
that
happening
are
less
than
40
percent
,
''
he
said
,
``
substantially
less
.

A

today
Wednesday
that
Japan
and
Russia	B	Russia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia
are
to
hold
a
summit
before
the

in
an
attempt
to
find
a
solution
to
their
dispute
about
the
Coral

,
which
has
hindered
the
signing
of
a
peace
treaty
between
the
two
countries
since
the
end
of
World
War
II
.
The
decision
to
hold
the
summit
was
made
during
the
meeting
between
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
and
Japanese
Prime
Minister
Yoshiro
Mori
on
the
periphery
of
the
Asia-Pacific
Economic
Cooperation
forum
in

not

since
then
.
Russia
and
Japan
have
been
unable
to
sign
a
peace

since
1945
because
of
their
dispute
concerning
four
of
the
Coral

located
between
Russia

Japan
and
which
were
invaded
by
Russian

Aixing
Dan
,
director
of
the
International
Co-operation
Department
of
the
Electric
Power
Industry
Ministry
,
on
this
matter
,
expressed
to
Xinhua
News
Agency
reporters
today
that
if
this
power
plant
is
successful
,
it
will
be
a
model
for
similar
plants
to
be
built
along
coastal
regions
.
Coal
,
water
,
oil
,
etc.
,
are
normally
used
for
traditional
electricity
generation
.
However
,
using
liquefied
natural
gas
as
fuel
for
joint
circulatory
electricity
generation
has
advantages
of
higher
power
generation
efficiency
and
lower
total
cost
,
is
beneficial
to
the
environment
,
etc.
.
According
to
presentations
,
with
this
type
of
electricity
generation
method
,
a
single
engine
with
liquefied
natural
gas
as
fuel
can
produce
waste
gas
with
temperatures
being
as
high
as
500
to
600
degrees
centigrade
.
This
gas
in
turn
can
heat
a
boiler
for
the
production
of
steam
to
turn
a
steam
turbine
which
generates
electricity
.
Because
of
the
efficiency
of
this
construction
method
,
the
electricity
generated
is
relatively
competitive
in
price
.
At
the
same
time
,
using
natural
gas
as
fuel
will
also
reduce
environmental
pollution
along
coastal
regions
.
The
Weir
Group
,
whose
headquarters
is
in
the
US
,
is
a
large
,
specialized
corporation
investing
in
the
area
of
electricity
generation
.
The
installed
capacity
of
electricity
it
has
invested
in
and
developed
globally
has
reached
15
million
kilowatts
.
Through
the
contact
of
the
Yizhong
Company
of
the
US
,
the
Weir
Group
and
the
Jiangsu
Electric
Power
Department
reached
an
initial
agreement
on
a
plan
to
build
a
joint
circulatory
electricity
generation
plant
.
This
power
plant
,
which
will
be
situated
in
Rudong	B	Rudong	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudong_County
,
Jiangsu
,
has
an
annual
generation
capacity
of
2.4
million
kilowatts
.
The
investment
amount
is
2.4

US
dollars
.
The
Chinese
side
holds
30
%
of
the
shares
while
the
Weir
Group
holds
70
%
.
According
to
the
agreement
,
the
Weir
Group
will
be
responsible
for
the
supply
of
natural
gas
from
the
international
market
for
use
by
the
power
plant
.
Renzu
Luo
,
managing
director
of
the

,
is
optimistic
over
the
prospect
of
using
liquefied
natural
gas
as
fuel
for
electricity
generation
along

's
coastal

.
He
holds
that
according
to
the
experience
of

energy
market
development
,
liquefied
natural
gas
has
become
the
main
material
of

,
environmental
protection
awareness
generally
rose

and
all
began
to
obviously
increase
usage
of
electricity
generated
by
liquefied
natural

.
As
the
gross

in
China

begins
to
approach
this
benchmark
,
it
can
be
said
to
have
had
the
conditions
for
electricity
generation
using
natural
gas
in
terms
of

signed
this

Lawyers
for
Vice
President
Al
Gore
said
Wednesday
their
only
chance
for
victory
in
his
contest
of
the
Florida
election
would
be
shattered
if
they
have
to
wait
until
Saturday
to
begin
counting
disputed
ballots
,
and
they
began
an
appeal
to
the
Florida
Supreme	B	Supreme_Court	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Florida
Court	I	Supreme_Court	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Florida
to
do
the
counting
itself
,
immediately
.
The
appeal
was
filed
with
the
District	B	District_Court_of_Appeal	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_District_Courts_of_Appeal
Court	I	District_Court_of_Appeal	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_District_Courts_of_Appeal

late
Wednesday
afternoon
,
and
will
be
submitted
to
the
state
's
highest
court
early
Thursday
,
Gore
's
lawyers
said
.
It
essentially
asks
the
Supreme
Court
to
take
over
Gore
's
contest
lawsuit
from
the
slow-moving
trial
court
,
to
count
the
ballots
itself
,
and
eventually
to
declare
Gore
the
winner
if
he
wins
the
recount
.
But
lawyers
for
Gov.
George
W.
Bush
said
they
had
no
intention
of
allowing
any
hand
counting
to
begin
without
a
vigorous
legal
fight
.
To
that
end
,
they
persuaded
Circuit
Judge
N.
Sanders
Sauls
to
order
1.1
million
ballots
_
every
vote
cast
in
Miami-Dade
and
Palm
Beach
counties
_
brought
up
from
south
Florida
and
placed
in
the
court
's
custody
.
That
represents
83
times
the
number
of
disputed
ballots
that
the
judge
had
agreed
on
Tuesday
to
transport
to
Tallahassee
at
the
Gore
team
's
request
.
And
it
could
take
weeks
if
not
months
to
count
them
all
,
the
point
that
Barry
Richard
,
Bush
's
chief
trial
lawyer
here
,
said
he
was
trying
to
make
in
requesting
that
the
ballots
be
transported
here
.
``
We
did
it
to
make
a
point
,
''
Richard
said
in
an
interview
.
``
If
you
recount
any
ballots
,
you
have
to
recount
all
of
them
.
Now
,
we
do
n't
think
any
ballots
should
be
counted
,
because
the
manual
recount
of
ballots
is
finished
.
But
in
the
event
the
court
determines
that
some
ballots
should
be
counted
,
we
wanted
them
here
so
they
could
all
be
counted
.
''
Aware
that
they
could
not
stop
the
movement
of
all
the
ballots
,
Gore
's
lawyers
barely
objected
to
the
move
,
asking
only
that
the
disputed
ballots
that
might
contain
hidden
Gore
votes
be
separated
from
the
mass
.
``
I
know
when
it
's
futile
,
''
said
David
Boies
,
Gore
's
chief
trial
lawyer
,
to
Sauls
.
Nonetheless
,
Gore
's
lawyers
were
furious
at
the
move
,
aware
that
it
represents
yet
another
enormous
barrier
to
their
hopes
for
an
immediate
count
of
the
14,000
disputed
ballots
in
the
two
counties
and
a
quick
decision
from
the
judge
that
Gore
really
won
the
election
.
Even
if
the
Florida
Supreme
Court
should
swiftly
agree
to
their
request
and
orders
the
counting
to
begin
by
Friday
,
that
would
still
put
them
three
days
behind
their
original
timetable
.
And
facing
a
Dec.
12
deadline
for
the
state
to
name
electors
for
the
Electoral	B	Electoral_College	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)
College	I	Electoral_College	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)
,
Gore
has
absolutely
no
days
to
spare
.
``
It
's
a
stunt
,
''
said
Kendall
Coffey
,
one
of
Gore
's
election
lawyers
,
as
he
stormed
out
of
Sauls
'
courtroom
Wednesday
,
referring
to
the
request
for
all
the
ballots
.
``
They
're
trying
to
bog
down
the
case
,
the
system
,
the
clerk
's
office
and
everywhere
else
they
can
.
''
The
decision
by
Gore
's
lawyers
to
appeal
the
case
shows
how
perilous
their
situation
is
.
By
appealing
,
the
lawyers
were
forced
to
put
on
paper
their
fear
that
their
case
could
be
over
if
they
can
not
begin
counting
ballots
until
Saturday
.
The
decision
to
wait
until
a
Saturday
hearing
``
is
effectively
a
final
order
denying
all
relief
sought
by
plaintiffs
because
the
action
now
pending
below
must
be
completed
before
Dec.
12
,
2000
,
in
order
to
offer
any
relief
,
''
said
the
notice
filed
with
the
Court
of
Appeal
.
It
adds
,
``
the
court
must
allow
sufficient
time
to
complete
an
accurate
and
fair
count
of
the
contested
ballots
,
which
is
essential
for
the
proper
resolution
of
the
contest
action
.
''
But
the
decision
to
bring
up
all
the
ballots
means
that
they
will
not
be
assembled
in
Tallahassee
until
late
Friday
,
a
day
later
than
planned
.
And
even
then
,
the
hurdles
are
enormous
.
There
will
have
to
be
another
hearing
before
the
Florida
Supreme
Court
,
and
Gore
's
lawyers
will
have
to
refute
three
arguments
to
be
raised
by
the
Bush
team
:
There
should
be
no
more
counting
at
all
;
if
there
is
any
counting
,
it
will
have
to
include
all
1.16
million
ballots
;
and
if
there
is
any
counting
of
disputed
ballots
,
dimples
can
not
be
counted
as
votes
.
If
these
issues
are
heard
before
Sanders
,
there
will
have
to
be
briefs
,
witnesses
,
and
evidence
on
each
point
,
which
could
take
days
.
If
the
Supreme
Court
agrees
to
short-circuit
the
process
,
there
will
still
have
to
be
lengthy
briefs
filed
,
and
the
court
may
need
to
wait
several
days
before
finding
time
for
yet
another
momentous
hearing
in
its
schedule
.

_
Check
times
between
connecting
flights
.
Airlines
often
book
tight
connections
and
do
not
take
responsibility
if
you
miss
yours
.
Assume
each
leg
of
your
flight
will
arrive

Monday

are
peak

times
for
business

Flights
leaving

are
less
likely
to
be
delayed

Avoid
electronic

Though
they
are
convenient
and
more
secure
than
an
easily

,
they
are
not
transferable
between
most
airlines
if
you
need
to
switch

_
Watch
for
labor
disruptions
.
Check
newspapers
and
Web
sites
like
www.thenewfoundlandgroup.com
to
identify
airlines
experiencing
labor
strife
,
which
often
increases
cancellations
and
delays
.
_
Leave
a
number

Make
sure
the
airline
you
book
with
has
a
phone
number
at
which
you
can
be
notified
of

Use
a

If

Flight
Is
Delayed
:
_
Keep
your
cool
.
Becoming
angry
at
airline
personnel
is
counterproductive

Sympathy

their
plight
will
sometimes
produce
results
.
_
Do
n't
stand
in
line
.
To
get
on
another
flight
,
it
is
often
more
effective
to
call
the
airline
from
the
airport
than
to
wait
at
the
ticket
counter
.
Carry
a
cell
phone
;
if
delays
are
widespread
,
public
telephones
may
be
in

Check

ask
your
airline
to
endorse
your
ticket

_
Get
what
you
paid
for
.
If
you
paid
full
fare
or
are
a
high-mileage
frequent
flier
,
let
the
airline
know
.
Your
odds
of
getting
a
seat
on
the
next
flight
out
will
increase
,
or
the
airline
might
pay
for
your
hotel
,
if
you
are
delayed
overnight
.
_
Consider
driving
.
If
the
last
leg
of
your
flight
is
a
200-mile
hop
,
renting
a
car
might
be
a
better
choice
than
waiting
out

delay

Even
:
_
Write
a
letter

The
airlines

traveled
abroad
.
In
his
last
few
years
,
however
,
he
had
sent
Bashar
,
educated
as
an
eye
doctor
,
on
foreign
trips
as
part
of
his
grooming
to
become
president
.
Prospects
appear
dim
for
progress
on
either
the
Syrian
or
Palestinian
peace
track
.
The
deadlock
in
Palestinian-Israeli
talks
is
exacerbated
by
the
worst
violence
in
four
years
.
Syria
's
government-run
media
said
last
week
that
no
progress
could
be
expected
now
because
of
the
U.S.
elections
and
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ehud
Barak
's
precarious
situation
as
leader
of
a
minority
government
.
Syrian-Israeli
peace
negotiations
broke
down
in
January
,
with
Syria
demanding
a
full
withdrawal
from
the
Golan
Heights
,
a
strategic
plateau
captured
by
Israel
in
1967
.
Israel
insists
on
waiting
to
settle
borders
until
it
knows
what
it
will
gain
by
returning
Golan
land
.
Assad
has
made
it
clear
he
intends
to
follow
his
father
's
course
in
any
negotiations
with
Israel
.
Mubarak
and
Assad
met
after
a
week
when
Russia
,
France
,
Jordan
and
Yemen
sent
planes
to
Baghdad
,
challenging
U.N.
sanctions
imposed
on
Iraq
after
its
1990
invasion
of
Kuwait
.
Iraq
is
hoping
other
Arab
countries
will
follow
,
despite
U.S.
complaints
,
easing
its
isolation
.
Moussa
said
the
presidents
discussed
the
situation
in
Iraq
and
would
return
to
it
Monday
.
However
,
he
would
not
comment
on
whether
Syria
and
Egypt
were
planning
to
send
planes
to
Baghdad
.
Egypt
and
Syria
are
on
good
terms
,
but
they
have
had
their
differences
.
Hafez
Assad
's
attempts
to
rally
Arab
leaders
to
present
a
unified
front
against
Israel
gained
little
ground
.
He
derided
Egypt
for
signing
a
peace
treaty
with
Israel
in
1979
.

Today
Wednesday
,
the
judges
in
charge
of
looking
into
the
Lockerbie
case
in
Camp
Zeist
(
Holland
)
were
faced
with
an
awkward
problem
:
how
to
deal
with
a
witness
who
is
refusing
to
answer
questions
and
who
is
at
the
same
time
serving
a
life
sentence
and
who
is
not
subject
to
Scottish
law
?
The
problem
arose
after
Palestinian
Mahmood
Abu
Talib
,
whose
testimony
the
court
has
been
hearing
since
Friday
,
refused
to
continue
answering
a
question
by
defense
lawyer
Richard
Keen
about
the
detailed
reasons
for
his
having
lived
in
the
former
Soviet	B	Soviet_Union	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union
Union	I	Soviet_Union	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union
for
a
period
of
18
months
in
the
70s
.
The
lawyer
asked
the
judges
to
force
Abu
Talib
to
answer
the
question
aimed
at
demonstrating
the
witness
's
``
professional
terrorism
''
precedents
.
46-year-old
Abu
Talib
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
in
1990
in
Sweden	B	Sweden	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden
for
terrorist
acts
in
Amsterdam	B	Amsterdam	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam
,
Copenhagen	B	Copenhagen	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen
and
Stockholm	B	Stockholm	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm
between
1985
and
1986
.
The
defense
council
in
the
Lockerbie
court
is
attempting
to
show
his
involvement
in
the
Lockerbie
attack
.
Based
on
Scottish
law
,
followed
in
this
court
,
if
Abu
Talib
insists
on
not
responding
to
the
question
,
this
is
considered
to
be
``
contempt
of
court
''
and
means
he
may
be
punished
in
accordance
with
Scottish
law
covering
such
incidents
.
The
problem
is
that
the
judges
may
not
punish
Abu
Talib
unless
Sweden
hands
him
over
to
Scotland
after
the
court
case
ends
to
apply
the
punishment
for
``
contempt
of
court
.
''
So
far
,
the
judges
have
not
asked
Abu
Talib
to
answer
the
defense
's
question
in
what
appears
to
be
a
move
to
avoid
a
tricky
situation
if
the
witness
refuses
to
answer
.
The
court
president
,
Ronald
Sutherland
,
who
adjourned
the
session
for
a
short
while
in
an
attempt
to
find
a
solution
to
this
dilemma
,
said
``

It

deer
hunting
season
in
Michigan
,
and
hunters
who
climb
trees
with
loaded
shotguns
have
state
officials
redoubling
safety
education
efforts
.
Two
men
have
been
killed
,
and
a
third
has
been
injured
since
the
hunting
season
opened
on
Nov.
15
.

a
practice
relatively
new
to
Michigan
hunters
_
shooting
at
deer
from
trees
.
The
Michigan
season
,
one
of
the
busiest
,
continues
through
Nov.
30
.
Firearm
hunting
from
elevated
platforms
has
long
been
legal
in
other
states
with
heavy
hunting
,
like
New	B	New_York	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York
York	I	New_York	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York
and
Pennsylvania	B	Pennsylvania	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania
.
But
the
practice
is
only
in
its
third
season
in
Michigan
,
and
officials
say
it
appears
that
hunters
still
have
a
lot
to
learn
about
safety
.
Lt.
Suzanne
Koppelo
,
hunter
safety

of
the
law
enforcement
division
of
the
Michigan
Department	B	Department_of_Natural_Resources	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Department_of_Natural_Resources

&UR;
,
&LR;
said
that
since
firearm
platform
hunting
began
in
Michigan
there
had
been
seven
shooting
accidents
linked
to
the
practice
.
Three
were
fatal
.
Two
hunters
shot
themselves
on
platforms
and
another
was
killed
on
the
ground
by
a
hunter
shooting
from
a
platform
.
``
If
hunters
exercised
the
kind
of
caution
one
would
expect
at
heights
of
20-some
feet
,
it
would
be
almost
a
nonissue
,
''
said
Koppelo
.
``
But
given
human
nature
,
that
's
not
the
case
.
''
More
than
750,000
licensed
hunters
are
taking
to
the
Michigan
woods
this
year
,
where
they
are
expected
to
kill
about
500,000
of
the
state
's
1.9
million
deer
.
The
numbers
reinforce
the
need
to
improve
education
about
platform
hunting
with
firearms
,
Koppelo
said
.
The
practice
is
more
commonly
associated
with
hunters
using
bows
and
arrows
.
Instead
of
hiding
on
the
ground
or
walking
through
the
woods
,
they
wait
quietly
,
typically
at
a
height
of
15
to
20
feet
,
and
fire
down
at
deer
that
wander
below
.
Despite
the
hunter
killed
from
the
platform
,
Sgt.
Larry
D.
Sargent
,
hunter
education
field
coordinator
for
the
law
enforcement
division
,
says
the
practice
does
offer
one
safety
advantage
:
errant
shots
typically
thump
harmlessly
to
the
ground
,
rather
than
whistling
through
the
woods
and
striking
other
people
.
The
problems
primarily
arise
when
hunters
get
in
and
out
of
position
.
``
It
's
kind
of
hard
climbing
a
tree
with
a
gun
,
''
Rob
Williams
said
,
as
he
and
a
hunting
partner
,
Art
Bush
,
waited
on
a
recent
morning
in
a
conventional
earthbound
hunting
blind
about
20
miles
west
of
Detroit	B	Detroit	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit
.
For
Williams
,
Rule
No.
1
is
not
to
climb
a
tree
with
a
loaded
gun
.
He
says
that
when
he
hunts
from
a
platform
he
climbs
up
with
a
rope
dangling
from
his
belt
to
his
gun
,
which
he
leaves
unloaded
on
the
ground
.
When
he
is
secure
in
his
stand
,
he
pulls
his
gun
up
after
him
and
loads
it
.
Sargent
says
this
is
proper
procedure
.
One
accident
this
year
,
however
,
illustrates
the
importance
of
following
each
step
of
the
safety
procedures
.
A
16-year-old
hunter
used
a
haul
line
,
but
it
was
tied
to
the
trigger
guard
and
he
left
the
gun
loaded
,
Koppelo
said
.
The
teen-ager
's
gun
went
off
and
he
was
shot
in
the
foot
.
Others
are
hurt
falling
out
of
trees
.
Koppelo
said
that
state
officials
were
trying
to
keep
count
of
these
injuries
but
that
it
was
difficult
,
since
they
relied
on
hunters
reporting
minor
accidents
.
``
A
lot
of
guys
are
embarrassed
,
''
Sargent
said
.
``
They
'll
say
they
fell
working
in
the
yard
or
something
.
''
Others
,
Koppelo
says
,
do
not
want
to
report
accidents
for
fear
the
law
will
be
changed
.
And
she
adds
that
though
anecdotal
reports
show
Michigan
's
large
hunting
population
to
be
taking
slowly
to
firearm
deer
hunting
from
platforms
,
most
expect
the
practice
to
catch
on
as
it
has
in
other
states
.
As
Peter
Thompson
,
a
16-year-old
hunter
,
said
,
``
Usually
the
deer
do
n't
look
up
.

Court	I	Supreme_Court	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
at
the
end
of
the
week
.
That
's
virtually
unprecedented
,
as
the
Federal
Courts
have
tended
to
stay
out
of
elections
,
which
are
the
responsibility
of
the
states
.
Joe	B	Joe_O'Grossman	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Grossman

.
He
says
that
in
this
instance
the
Supreme
Court
probably
felt
the
circumstances
were
such
that
they
had
no
real
alternative
but
to
take
the
case
.
Well
,
I
think
they
took
the
case
because
it
seemed
like
it
was
such
a
important
issue
that
it
would
be
kind
of
unseemly
for
them
to
try
to
reject
it
out
of
hand
.
In
fact
,
I
think
that
Lawrence	B	Lawrence_Tribe	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Tribe
Tribe	I	Lawrence_Tribe	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Tribe
,
the
Harvard
Law
School
Professor
who
is
arguing
for
Gore	B	Gore	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore
tomorrow
,
is
going
to
ask
the
court
to
hold
the
case
,
moot
and
dismiss
it
.
And
the
Bush
campaign
has
brought
the
case
,
but
recognizes
that
the
particular
issues
that
they
brought
to
the
court
last
week
are
really
not
very
relevant
anymore
.
They
are
going
to
probably
,
well
,
I
know
what
they
are
going
to
do
.
They
are
going
to
try
to
broaden
the
case
to
make
it
a
kind
of
a
general
referendum
on
election
procedures
.
So
,
they
are
looking
for
a
coronation
.
And
the
Gore
people
at
this
point
just
want
to
get
rid
of
this
case
,
because
they
think
they
have
a
better
chance
in
the
Florida
courts
.
Republicans
generally
support
states
'
rights
.
So
,
does
it
appear
somewhat
ironic
that
they
are
going
to
the
Supreme
Court
in
this
instance
?
No
,
I
think
first
of
all
the
notion
that
Republicans
favor
states
'
rights
and
Democrats
oppose
it
,
is
much
too
simplistic
.
That
's
generally
true
,
but
it
's
only
true
on
some
issues
.
And
in
this
case
,
you
could
argue
that
the
Bush
people
are
going
to
the
Supreme
Court
to
preserve
the
right
of
Florida
,
to
determine
its
own
electors
.
So
,
there
is
a
kind
of
states
'
rights
issue
there
.
But
they
need
,
or
at
least
they
once
thought
they
needed
the
Supreme
Court
to
endorse
it
.
So
it
goes
both
ways
.
What
are
the
justices
likely
looking
for
?
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
But
I
think
that
-
and
I
think
they
will
be
divided
,
I
mean
I
do
n't
think
they
will
be
unanimous
.
Obviously
,
they
would
like
to
be
able
to
achieve
some
kind
of
resolution
of
the
case
.
American
election
laws
are
often
challenged
at
the
local
level
and
sometimes
in
the
Federal
courts
,
but
this
is
certainly
the
first
time
we
have
had
a
Supreme
Court
challenge
over
presidential
election
.
So
,
there
is
a
lot
of
new
law
here
to
be
made
or
at
least
law
that
has
n't
been
made
yet
.
It
's
possible
that
if
the
court
accepts
the
invitation
of
the
Bush
campaign
,
at
least
as
it
is
expressed
in
the
briefs
they
submitted
yesterday
,
that
the
court
will
in
the
sense
,
take
the
entire
issue
,
even
-
not
just
the
specific
questions
that
it
was
asked
last
week
and
try
to
resolve
the
question
.
For
example
,
if
the
court
says
it
is
clearly
the
fact
that
the
legislature	B	legislature	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Legislature
of
the
state
of
Florida
can
determine
for
itself
who
its
electors
will
be
,
that
will
pretty
much
end
the
case
,
because
that
's
what
the
legislature
already
plans
to
do
.
And
that
does
n't
mean
the
Gore
people
wo
n't
keep
trying
,
because
ultimately
Congress	B	Congress	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress
has
to
decide
and
only
Congress
can
decide
if
there
are
competing
slates
of
electors
submitted
,
which
slate
to
accept
.
The
Johns
Hopkins
University
constitutional
law
professor
Joe
O'Grossman
says
,
it
's
still
not
certain
the
Supreme
Court
will
actually
hear
the
Florida
case
.
As
their
first
order
,
business
Friday
,
attorneys
for
Vice
President
Gore
will
move
to
have
the
court
dismiss
the
case
brought
by

Back
in
January
,
when
Internet
stocks
were
hot
,
America
Online
agreed
to
buy
Time
Warner
with
AOL
stock
.
The
deal
,
if
approved
by
regulators
,
would
leave
AOL
shareholders
with
55
percent
of
the
merged
company
,
even
though
Time
Warner
's
revenue
and
cash
flow
are
far
greater
.
Since
then
,
AOL
's
stock
has
fallen
by
almost
a
third
,
destroying
most
of
the
premium
the
company
had
offered
for
control
of
Time	B	Time_Warner	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner
Warner	I	Time_Warner	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner
.
So
a
Time
Warner
shareholder
might
conclude
that
America
Online
's
chairman
,
Stephen
Case
,
had
bamboozled
his
Time
Warner
counterpart
,
Gerald
Levin
,
into
taking
AOL
's
shares
at
the
worst
possible
time
.
``
Short
term
,
anyone
objective
would
say
probably
Steve
got
the
better
part
of
the
deal
,
''
said
Larry
Haverty
,
a
senior
vice
president
at
State	B	State_Street_Research	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Street_Corporation
Street	I	State_Street_Research	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Street_Corporation
Research	I	State_Street_Research	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Street_Corporation
in
Boston	B	Boston	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston
and
a
longtime
media
investor
.
But
Haverty
,
like
many
other
Time
Warner
shareholders
and
industry
analysts
,
hardly
cares
.
With
the
merger
likely
to
be
completed
later
this
month
,
he
predicts
that
the
merged
company
will
grow
quickly
by
combining
AOL
's
marketing
skills
and
captive
base
of
online
users
with
Time
Warner
's
huge
library
of
films
,
magazines
and
the
like
and
its
relationships
with
major
advertisers
.
``
The
deal
strategically
and
financially
makes
all
the
sense
in
the
world
,
''
Haverty
said
.
``
Five
years
out
,
if
you
're
a
shareholder
in
this
company
,
you
're
going
to
be
a
happy
camper
.
''
That
view
is
widely
shared
.
``
Strategically
,
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense

``

of
the
other
one
.
They
're
subscription-advertising
combo
models
.
The
reality
is
the
pieces
are
very
compatible
.
''
To
be
sure
,
the
recent
history
of
big
media
mergers
is
hardly
comforting
for
shareholders
in
either
AOL
or
Time
Warner
.
Disney	B	Disney	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company
stumbled
badly
after
it
bought
Capital	B	Capital_Cities/ABC	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Cities_Communications
Cities/ABC	I	Capital_Cities/ABC	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Cities_Communications
in
1996
,
and
Time
Warner
stagnated
for
five
years
after
it
was
created
in
1990
by
the
merger
of
Time	B	Time	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Inc.
and
Warner	B	Warner	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Communications
.
``
Huge
deals
are
really
hard
to
do
and
create
a
lot
of
uncertainty
,

McNamee	I	Roger_McNamee	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_McNamee
of
Integral
Capital
,
which
sold
its
404,000
AOL
shares
the
day
the
merger
was
announced
.
But
if
the
merged
company
can
overcome
that
hurdle
,
it
will
have
big
advantages
over
Disney
and
other
traditional

``

multiple
distribution
platforms
that
they
have
,
it

a
very
powerful

engine

John

portfolio
manager
at
Janus	B	Janus_Capital	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_Capital_Group
Capital	I	Janus_Capital	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_Capital_Group
,
the
mutual
fund
company
that
is
Time
Warner
's
largest
shareholder
,
with
more
than
120
million
shares
,
said
the
companies
had
already
begun
to
demonstrate
how
they
would
work
together
.
For
example
,
AOL
has
pitched
Time
Warner
's
magazines
to
its
users
,
resulting
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
subscriptions
.
And
the
companies
are
trying
to
sell
big
advertisers
on
deals
that
will
reach
both
America
Online
users
and
the
people
who
watch
Time
Warner
cable
channels
and
read
its
magazines
,
Schreiber
said
.
``
Once
the
merger
closes
,
I
think
you
'll
see
some
very
powerful
cross-promotional
deals
across
all
of
Time
Warner
's
advertisers
,
''
he
said
.
Schreiber
also
says
the
risk
of
cultural
clashes
between
the
companies
is
limited
,
because
the
companies
disclosed
publicly
where
top
executives
would
stand
in
the
combined
company
only
a
few
weeks
after
the
merger
was
announced
.
So
people
who
feel
their
responsibilities
have
been
diminished
have
had
months
to
look
for
new
jobs
,
and
some
have
already
left
,
he
said
.
Given
the
strength
he
sees
in
the
combined
company
,
Schreiber
said
the
question
of
whether
Levin
could
have
negotiated
a
better
deal
with
America
Online
is
moot
.
Shares
in
cable
companies
like
Comcast	B	Comcast	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast
have
fallen
15
percent
or
more
this
year
,
while
big
media
companies
have
been
flat
or
up
slightly
.
So
``
it
's
not
as
if
Time
Warner
shareholders
have
lost
out
on
a
great
deal
of
upside
,
''
Schreiber
said

an

as

the
delay
in
announcing
the
final
results
of
the

elections

it
improved

Nearly
17
months
after
he
first
issued
his
call
for
a
``
fresh
start
after
a
season
of
cynicism
,
''
Gov.
George
W.
Bush
ended
his
quest
for
the
presidency
Monday
on
a
nearly
identical
note
,
pledging
to
purge
Washington	B	Washington	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.
of
what
he
cast
as
a
crippling
discord
.
The
course
that
Bush
charted
over
his
final
hours
on
the
campaign
trail
,
plotted
with
as
much
concern
for
symbolism
as
for
raw
electoral
arithmetic
,
left
no
doubt
about
where
he
placed
the
blame
for
that
atmosphere
.
His
first
major
rally
was
in
Tennessee
and
his
last
was
planned
for
Arkansas	B	Arkansas	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas
,
the
home
states
,
respectively
,
of
Vice
President
Al
Gore
and
President
Clinton
.
The
Texas
governor
's
words
made
equally
clear
that
he
saw
himself
as
the
country
's
best
hope
for
bridging
ideological
divides
,
healing
partisan
wounds
and
making
sure
that
Americans
could
gaze
upon
the
White	B	White_House	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House
House	I	White_House	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House
with
unfettered
respect
.
``
There
's
a
better
day
ahead
if
we
have
a
leader
who
's
willing
to
unite
the
country
,
to
bring
people
together
,
to
elevate
the
people
's
business
above
everyday
politics
,
''
Bush
said
at
a
rally
inside
a
hangar
at
the
airport
here
,
where
supporters
'
chants
evoked
the
nearness
of
the
moment
of
decision
.
``
One
more
day
!
''
they
roared
.
``
One
more
day
!
''
What
the
nation
needed
,
Bush
told
them
,
was
``
a
president
who
can
unite
this
nation
,
a
president
who
puts
aside
the
endless
partisan
bickering
that
seems
to
gridlock
our
nation
's
capitol
,
a
president
who
puts
the
people
first
,
a
president
who
lifts
this
nation
's
spirits
.
``
I
'll
be
that
president
,
''
he
added
,
a
sentence
that
was
equal
parts
promise
and
prediction
.
It
underscored
the
optimism
that
Bush
has
,
from
the
very
beginning
,
sought
to
project
to
voters
.
His
schedule
over
the
course
of
a
16-hour
day
was
also
an
expression
of
that
confidence
.
In
between
Tennessee
and
Arkansas
,
his
campaign
plane
touched
down
in
Wisconsin	B	Wisconsin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin
and
Iowa	B	Iowa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa
,
and
while
any
one
of
those
four
states
could
wind
up
providing
the
key
to
a
Bush
victory
,
none
have
as
many
electoral
votes
as
such
battlegrounds
as
Michigan	B	Michigan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan
and
Pennsylvania	B	Pennsylvania	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania
.
But
they
are
genuine
tossups
that
were
initially
predicted
to
be
much
more
hospitable
to
Gore
.
By
visiting
them
Monday
,
Bush
emphasized
the
breadth
of
his
appeal
and
the
sometimes
surprising
vulnerability
of
the
vice
president
.
He
did
not
let
his
assertion
of
strength
and
confidence
distract
him
from
the
important
business
of
beseeching
supporters
to
grant
him
victory
.
With
just
24
hours
before
Election
Day
,
Bush
in
many
ways
stripped
campaigning
to
its
essence
:
coaxing
and
cajoling
,
pleading
and
persuading
.
``
I
want
you
to
understand
that
I
ca
n't
win
without

may
not
be
feeling
any
regrets
about
his
Green

presidential
campaign
,
but
some
visitors
to
the
chat
room
on
Nader2000.org
,
Nader
's
official
campaign
website
,
sounded
as
if
a
bad
hangover
had
come
crashing
down
on
them
.
There
was
this
entry
,
for
instance
,
posted
Thursday
morning
by
a

named

:
``
I

I

Ralph

's
enjoyment
of
all

this
is
an
indication
of
a
man
more
concerned
with
vindictive
politics
than
the
future
of

I
am
no

Instead
,
I
'm
a
member
of

green
movement

a
movement
without
Ralph
Nader
.
''
Or
this
one
,
also
posted
Thursday
morning
,
from
``
Noni
''
:
``
I
saw
an
interview
with
Ralph
Nader
today
and
he
seemed
to
be
enjoying
what
has
happened
!
I
've
never
seen
him
smile
so
broadly
.
I
regret
my
support
.
Nader
,
you
're
a
well-intending
man

I
agree
with

of

the
symbolic
run
for
the
White	B	White_House	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House
House	I	White_House	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House
has
destroyed
our
Party
and
our
cause
.
Very
bad
things
are
in
our
future
.
You
should
not
be
smiling
.
And
we
,
the
misled
,
should
feel
shame
for
what
we
've
done
.
''
The
remarks
expressed
fears
that
votes
for
Nader
may
have
put
Gov.
George
W.
Bush
in
a
position
to
defeat
Vice
President
Al
Gore
.
In
Florida	B	Florida	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida
,
where
Gore
trailed
Bush
by
only
a
few
hundred
votes
Thursday
,
a
shift
of
just
a
fraction
of
Nader
's
95,000
votes
could
have
given
the
state
,
and
the
White
House
,
to
Gore
,
the
most
likely
major-party
alternative
for
Nader
's
supporters
.
John
Ruth
,
for
example
,
wrote
on
the
Nader2000
site
Thursday
morning
that
he
voted
for
Nader
because
he
thought
they
``
shared
a
common
goal
''
but
that
he
was
now
regretting
it
.
``
Gore
(
despite
what
you
have
said
)
is
NOT
an
environmental
clone
of
G.W.

.
Because
of
your
actions
and
statements
prior
to
Nov.
7th
,
we
are
on
the
brink
of
a
Bush
presidency
.
No

no

no

ever
again

''
And
in
Oregon	B	Oregon	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon
,
a
state
that
was
still
too
close
to
call
Thursday
afternoon
,
Nader
won
about
5
percent
of
the
vote
_
enough
to
cause
some
Nader
voters
to
feel
morning-after
qualms
.
Julie
Quastler
,
28
,
who
voted
for
Nader
in
Portland	B	Portland	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon
,
said
on
Wednesday
that
she
was
feeling
``
a
little
alarmed
and
disappointed
''
that
Bush
seemed
on
the
brink
of
winning
the
presidency
_
suggesting
that
she
did
not
accept
Nader
's
assertion
that
the
two
parties
were
equally
bad
.
``
I
'm
just
so
sad
,
''
she
said
.
``
Bush
is
probably
going
to
be
our
president
and
Nader
did
n't
get
his
5
percent
.
It
seems
like
a
lose-lose
end
result
in
some
ways
.
''
Winning
5
percent
of
the
vote
nationwide
would
have
qualified
the
Green
Party
for
millions
of
dollars
in
federal
campaign
funds
in
2004
.
But
Quastler
,
the
development
director
for
a
nonprofit
cafe
,
said
she
did
not
feel
guilty
about
her
vote
.
``
I
voted
for
Nader
because
he
was
most
aligned
with
my
values
,
''
she
said
.
Of
course
,
there
were
also
countless
verbal
high-fives
among
Nader
supporters
Thursday
who
felt
the
Green
Party
had
sent
a
bracing
wake-up
call
to
the
two
major
parties
.
``
Stand
tall
and
proud

``
We

does
not
make
us
villains

''
Such
sentiments
seemed
particularly
strong
in
Florida
.

phone
calls
and
e-mails
from

,
but
has
yet
to
receive
one
regretful
note
from
a
Nader
voter
.
``
I
can
see
positives
for
the
Greens
with
either
Bush
or

being
president

she
said
.
``
If
