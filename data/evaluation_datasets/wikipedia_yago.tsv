The
cause
of

is
the
poor

of

by

.
The

are
more

Reapportionment

reflected
the
increasing
population
balance
between
eastern

western
Iowa
,
resulting
in
a
westward
shift
of
the
district

boundaries

After

never

General	I	Iowa_General_Assembly	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_General_Assembly
Assembly	I	Iowa_General_Assembly	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_General_Assembly
refused
to
reapportion
its
districts
until
the
loss
of
two
seats
following
the
1930
census
left
the
State
with
no
other
choice
.


The
district
was
predominantly
rural
,
especially
in
its
1886
reconfiguration
.
During
that
period
,
it
included
only
one
of
Iowa
's
twenty
largest
cities
--
Fort	B	Fort_Dodge	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Dodge,_Iowa
Dodge	I	Fort_Dodge	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Dodge,_Iowa
--
and
included
counties
that
had
been
relatively
slow
to
settle
.
However
,
by
1895
the
large
area
of
the
10th
District
,
coupled
with
increased
migration
to
its
small
towns
,
caused
it
to
have
the
largest
population
of
any
of
Iowa
's
congressional
districts
.
By
1890
,
the
continued
disproportionate
increase
in
the
population
of
the
10th
and
11th	B	11th	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa's_11th_congressional_district
Districts
caused
some
to
predict
that
the
General
Assembly
would
need
to
reduce
the
area
of
each
district
,
but
no
such
change
occurred
.
By
1921
,
the
10th
District
had
over
100,000
more
residents
than
the
1st
District
,
and
nearly
60,000
more
than
the
population
of
an
ideally-sized
Iowa
congressional
district
.


Every
congressman
elected
from
this
district
was
a
member
of
the
Republican	B	Republican_Party	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)
Party	I	Republican_Party	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)
.
As
a
general
matter
,
the
most
influential
event
during
each
election
year
was
not
the
November
general
election
,
but
the
Republican
Party
's
district
nominating
convention
(
or
later
,
the
Republican
primary
)
.

and
)
became
well-known
members
of
the
U.S.
Senate
and
sought
national
office
.


Under
the
nine-district
plan
adopted
by
the
Iowa
General
Assembly
in
1931
,
the
boundaries
of
the
old
10th
district
were
preserved
as
the

8th
district

Ten
years
later
,
when
the
1940
census
caused
Iowa
to
lose
another
seat
,
the
new
6th

included

the
single
qualification
berth
.
The
final
play-off
saw

.


The
group
stages
showed
the
inequalities
in
the
Asian
game
;
Japan
won
103-9
against
Malaysia
,
whilst
Hong
Kong
thrashed
Singapore
164-13

Japan
again
emerged
victorious

and
the
winner

,
Najib
Chebbi
and
the

were
harassed
by
the
police
for
years
,
and
verbally
attacked
by

After
unsuccessfully
participating
in

from
1989

,
the
party
decided
to
boycot
the

,
its
leaders
Najib

hunger

earned

the
``
little
castle

at
Bolsover

a
then-recent
(
Jacobean

construction
.
The
pillared
hall
there
was
furnished
with
five
brilliantly-colored
paintings
on
the
theme
of
The
Senses
;
Jonson
alludes
to
the
paintings
in
his
text
.
The
show
was
described
by
local
witnesses
as
``
stupendous
,
''
more
than
adequate
to
establish
Newcastle
's
reputation
as
the
greatest
``
prince
...
in
all
the
northern
quarter
''
of
the
kingdom
.
Perhaps
the
most
visually
striking
element
in
the
masque
lay
in
the
two
Cupids
,
Eros
(
Love
)
and
Anteros
(
Love
Returned
)
,
who
descended
``
from
the
clouds
''
bearing
fronds
of
palms
.

He
later
collected
a
Leinster	B	Leinster	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leinster_Senior_Club_Hurling_Championship
title
,
although
the
one-point
defeat
of
UCD	B	UCD	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCD_GAA
was
in
controversial
circumstances
.
The
James
Stephens
club
subsequently
qualified
for
the
All-Ireland
final
with
Athenry	B	Athenry	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenry_GAA
providing
the
opposition
.
A
victory
for
``
the
village
''
gave
Tyrrell
a
coveted
All-Ireland	B	All-Ireland	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Club_Hurling_Championship
club
medal
.


James
Stephens
retained
the
county
championship
in
2005
,
with
Tyrrell
winning
a
second
hurling
medal
following
a
1-18
to
2-12
defeat
pf
.
He
later
picked
up
a
second
Leinster
club
medal
following
a
second
consecutive
triumph
over
UCD
.
James
Stephens
were
subsequently
trounced
by
eventual
winners
Portumna	B	Portumna	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portumna_GAA
in
the
All-Ireland
semi-final
.


After
a
six-year
gap
Tyrrell
won
a
third
hurling
championship
in
2011
after
a
thrilling
draw
and
replay
with
Ballyhale
Shamrocks
.


Tyrrell
first
came
to
prominence
on
the
inter-county
scene
as
a
member
of
the
Kilkenny	B	Kilkenny	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilkenny_GAA
under-21
team
.
Success
was
slow
in
coming
in
this
grade
as
Wexford	B	Wexford	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wexford_GAA
dominated
in
the
early
years
of
the
new
century
.
In
2003
Kilkenny
defeated
Dublin	B	Dublin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_GAA
by
0-12
to
1-4
giving
Tyrrell
a
Leinster	B	Leinster	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leinster_Under-21_Hurling_Championship
medal
in
that
grade
.
He
later
lined
out
in
the
under-21
championship
decider
with
Galway	B	Galway	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway_GAA
providing
the
opposition
.
Kilkenny
won
that
game
by
2-13
to
0-12
with
Tyrrell
collecting
a
coveted
All-Ireland	B	All-Ireland	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Under-21_Hurling_Championship
medal
and
collecting
the
cup
as
captain
.


In
2003
Tyrrell
joined
the
Kilkenny
senior
team
for
the
first
time
.
He
was
a
non-playing
substitute
that
year
as
`
the
Cats
'
claimed
the
All-Ireland	B	All-Ireland	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship
,
Leister	B	Leister	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leinster_Senior_Hurling_Championship
and
National	B	National_League	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurling_League
League	I	National_League	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurling_League
titles
.


Tyrrell
made
his
competitive
debut
for
Kilkenny
in
a
National
League
game
against
Waterford	B	Waterford	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford_GAA
in
2004
.
He
was
a
regular
during
that
league
campaign
,
however
,
he
played
no
part
in
the
subsequent
championship
.


Kilkenny
were
back
in
form
in
2005
,
with
Tyrrell
winning
his
first
National
League
medal
following
a
huge
3-20
to
0-15
victory
over
Clare
.
Kilkenny
later
defeated
Wexford
by
0-22
to
1-16
in
the
provincial
decider
,
giving
Delaney
a
first
Leinster
winners
'
medal
.
While
a
third
successive
All-Ireland
showdown
with
Cork
seemed
likely
,
Galway
defeated
Kilkenny
in
the
All-Ireland
semi-final
in
one
of
the
games
of
the
decade
.


In
2006
Tyrrell
was
appointed
captain
for
the
year
.
He
added
a
second
consecutive
National
League
medal
to
his
collection
following
a
3-11
to
0-14
victory
over
Limerick	B	Limerick	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_GAA
.
He
later
won
his
second
Leinster
medal
following
another
facile
victory
over
Wexford
.
The
subsequent
All-Ireland
decider
pitted
Kilkenny
against
Cork	B	Cork	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_GAA
.
The
Leesiders
were
aiming
for
a
third
All-Ireland
victory
in-a-row
;
however
,
revenge
was
foremost
in
the
minds
of
Kilkenny
as
it
was
Cork
who
denied
their
three-in-a-row
bid
in
2004
.
On
the
day
Kilkenny
were
far
too
strong
for
Cork
as
`
the
Cats
'
secured
a
1-16
to
1-13
victory
.
It
was
Walsh
's
first
All-Ireland
winners
'
medal
,
while
he
also
had
the
honour
of
lifting
the
as
captain
.


Tyrrell
collected
a
third
Leinster
medal
in-a-row
in
2007
following
another
facile
victory
in
the
provincial
decider
.
Kilkenny
later
qualified
for
the
All-Ireland
final
where
,
surprisingly
,
Limerick	B	Limerick	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick_GAA
provided
the
opposition
.
Kilkenny
got
off
to
a
flying
start
with
Eddie	B	Eddie_Brennan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Brennan
Brennan	I	Eddie_Brennan	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Brennan
and
Henry	B	Henry_Shefflin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Shefflin
Shefflin	I	Henry_Shefflin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Shefflin
scoring
two
goals
within
the
first
ten
minutes
and
went
on
to
win
the
game
by
2-19
to
1-15
.
It
was
Tyrrell
's
second
consecutive
All-Ireland
medal
.
He
was
later
presented
with
a
coveted
award
.


2008
saw
Kilkenny
launch
an
all-out
attack
in
an
attempt
to
capture
a
third
All-Ireland
title
in-a-row
.
Tyrrell
collected
a
fourth
Leinster
winners
'
medal
after
a
5
--
21
to
0
--
17
defeat
of
Wexford
in
the
provincial
final
,
before
later
lining
out
in
the
All-Ireland
decider
.
Waterford	B	Waterford	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford_GAA
provided
the
opposition
,
however
,
Kilkenny
recorded
an
enormous
3
--
30
to
1
--
13
victory
.
It
was
a
third
All-Ireland
winners
'
medal
for
Tyrrell
.
A
second
All-Star
award
quickly
followed
.


Tyrrell
won
his
third
National
League
winners
'
medal
in
2009
following
a
thrilling
4-17
to
2-26
defeat
of
Tipperary	B	Tipperary	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipperary_GAA
.
A
fifth
Leinster
medal
quickly
followed
before
Kilkenny
set
out
to
make
history
by
becoming
the
second
team
in
hurling
history
to
win
four
successive
All-Ireland
finals
.
Tipperary	B	Tipperary	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipperary_GAA
were
the
opponents
and
,
for
much
of
the
match
,
it
looked
as
if
they
would
pull
off
a
shock
and
deny
`
the
Cats
'
the
title
.
Two
quick
goals
in
the
space
of
a
minute
,
one
from
a
penalty
by
Henry
Shefflin
,
sealed
a
2
--
22
to
0
--
23
victory
.
It
was
Tyrrell
's
fourth
consecutive
All-Ireland
medal
.
He
later
won
a
third
All-Star
award
.


Tyrrell
added
a
sixth
Leinster
winners
'
medal
to
his
collection
in
2010
following
a
1-19
to
1-12
defeat
of
new
provincial
rivals
Galway
.
Kilkenny
faced
a
number
of
injury
worries
going
into
an
historic
All-Ireland
final
,
and
ultimately
failed
in
their
`
drive
for
five
'
as
Tipperary
won
by
4-17
to
1-18
.
In
spite
of
the
defeat
Delaney
later
won
a
fourth
successive
All-Star
award
.


In
2011
`
the
Cats
'
continued
their
provincial
dominance
with
Tyrrell
winning
a
seventh
consecutive
Leinster
winners
'
medal
following
a
defeat
of
Dublin	B	Dublin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_GAA
.
Kilkenny
later
qualified
for
a
sixth
consecutive
All-Ireland
final
.
For
the
third
year
in
succession
Tyrrell
's
side
faced
Tipperary
,
however
,
on
this
occasion
Kilkenny
were
slight
underdogs
going
up
against
the
new
champions
.
Kilkenny
started
quickly
and
never
surrendered
the
lead
in
the
2-17
to
1-16
victory
.
It
was
Delaney
's
fifth
All-Ireland
winners
'
medal
.


2012
began
well
for
Kilkenny
.
A
trouncing
of
old
rivals
Cork
gave
Tyrrell
a
fourth
National
League
winners
'
medal
.
After
losing
the
Leinster
final
to
GAlway	B	GAlway	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway_GAA
,
both
sides
subsequently
met
in
the
All-Ireland
decider
and
Galway
nearly
pulled
off
a

The
``
Hong
Kong
Family
Welfare
Society
''
was
formally
known
as
the
Social
Service
Centre
of
the
Churches
.
It
was
founded
in
1938
,
but
only
became
a
public
agency
on
January
1
,
1949
.
The
Society
started
out
by
being
heavily
involved
with
relief
work
after

War	I	World_War_II	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II

.
After
concerns
for
the
growth
of
distressed
families
resonated
with
the
members
,
the
Society
further
expanded
its
scope
.
Today
the
bulk
of
their
work
revolves
around
counselling
families
with
management
difficulties
or
communication
issues
.
In
addition
,
the
Society
focuses
on
preventive
measures
for
family
problems
,
resulting
in
the
creation
of
Family

in
1971

Other
services
like

For
information
on
these
centres
:


One
of
the
methods
of
relieving
tension
in
families
is
the
use
of
mediation
.
This
is
vital
due
to
the
sharp
increase
in
divorce
rates
in
Hong
Kong
and
the
lack
of
communication
between
parents
and
children
.
Mediation
is
used
in
a
bid
to
help
salvage
the
family
situation
.
It
teaches
individuals
to
reach
a
settlement
acceptable
to
all
parties
.
The
Society
also
provides
five
types
of
services
and
programs
namely
;
Special
and
Innovative
Services
,
Children
and
Youth
,
Elderly
and
Community
,
Family
and
Child
Care
.
The
Special
and
Innovative
Services
includes
programmes
for
employment
and
fund
assistance
.


HKFWS
also
has
a
subsidiary
association
called
the
where
seminars
and
mediation
services
are
available
to
the
public
.


Due
to
the
nature
of
the
HKFWS
as

from
the

list
of
the
structure
and

:


The
Society
encourages
individuals
to
become
volunteers
.


The
function
of
the
Corporate
Volunteer
Service
is
to
link
voluntary
organizations
and
service
users
to
volunteers
.
Over
the
years
,
many
corporations
,
schools
,
non-profit
organizations
and
government
bodies
have
played
their
part
in
providing
services
to
the
HKFWS
service

that
consists
of
ethnic
minorities

families
.


The
organization
seeks
to
advocate
family
volunteering
so
that
family
members
will
share
experiences
thus
producing
solidarity
.


At
present
,
the
revamped
services
operated
by
the

The
HKFWS
and

that
has
allowed
members
to
interact
with
the

The
club
was
founded
in
1908
under
the
name
Stade
Forézien
Universitaire
.
They
went
through
a
difficult
time
in
the
1960s
,
and
had
to
merge
with
the
CASE
omnisport
structure
in
1975
at
the
request
of
the
municipality
.
It
did
not
help
turn
back
the
tide
,
however
,
and
poor
results
and
fewer
and
fewer
licensed
players
forced
the
club
to
withdraw
its
senior
team
from
all
competitions
in
1991
.
The
next
year
,
the
club
was
restarted
in
4ème
Série
,
the
lowest
French
rugby
division
,
and
was
able
to
climb
the
ladder
,
gaining
promotion
to
Fédérale	B	Fédérale_3	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fédérale_3

in
2004

one
year
after
merging
with
the
neighbouring
club

and
adopting
its
current
name

In

promoted
to
Fédérale	B	Fédérale_2	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fédérale_2

A
mere
two
years
later
,
they
finished
13th
overall
in
the
championship
,
with
the
top
12
clubs
being
promoted
to
Fédérale

.
However
,
declined
their
promotion
,
sending
Saint-Étienne
to
the
top
amateur
division
for
the
first
time
.


For
their
first
season
in

and
on

This
run
of
good
form
allowed
them
to
clinch
the
fourth
place
in
their
group
and
thus
to
qualify
for
the
Trophée

In

they
finished

behind

Saint-Étienne
stunned
them
by
winning
both
legs
(
12

,
24

20
away
)
,
inflicting
them
their
only

In
the
semis
,
they
took
on
Bourg-en-Bresse	B	Bourg-en-Bresse	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Sportive_Bressane

The
popular
support
for
the
team
was
such
that
the
municipality
allowed
the
first
leg
to
be

to
see
the
locals
take
the
slenderest

into

with

in

sent
Saint-Étienne
in

In

learning
the
strategy
behind
playing
poker
.
Two
years
later
he
became
a
,
a
player
who
travels
the
country
looking
for
gambling
action
.


In
1949
,
Moss
played
with
in
a
five
month
long
``
heads
up
''
poker
marathon
set
up
by
Benny	B	Benny_Binion	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Binion
Binion	I	Benny_Binion	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Binion
,
winning
between
$
2
and
$
4
million
.
At
the
conclusion
of
the
game
,
Nick
the
Greek
uttered
what
has
become
one
of
the
most
famous
poker
quotes
ever
:
``
Mr.
Moss
,
I
have
to
let
you
go
.
''
This
game
is
often
cited
as
the
inspiration
behind
the
WSOP
.
This
game
became
the
foundation
for
Al
Alvarez
's
book
The
Biggest
Game
in
Town
and
is
one
of
the
best
known
stories
in
poker
.
Despite
being
one
of
the
best
known
poker
stories
,
a
soon
to
be
released
book
,
Showgirl
Stories
,
by
Steve
Fischer
claims
the
game
never
took
place
.
According
to
Fischer
,
there
were
no
stories
or
reports
of
this
tournament
until
six
years
after
Nick
's
death
.
Binion
never
spoke
of
the
game
even
when
providing
a
detailed
history
of
Las
Vegas
and
avoided
answering
questions
about
the
game
by
saying
,
``
Well
,
my
memory
ai
n't
what
it
used
to
be
.
''
While
Nick
the
Greek
was
often
covered
by
the
national
media
,
there
are
no
news
reports
in
any
Vegas
or
national
source
.
Fischer
says
that
nearly
every
version
of
the
story
is
virtually
identical
to
the
version
first
told
by
Moss
beginning
around
1971
.
The
story
is
consistently
said
to
have
taken
place
in
1949
at
the
Horseshoe
Casino
,
a
casino
that
did
not
exist
for
another
year
and
a
half
.
Fischer
also
points
out
that
during
the
time
that
Binion
supposedly
set
up
the
game
,
he
was
fighting
off
a
request
from
Texas
to
have
him
extradited
.
Because
of
his
past
,
Binion
lost
his
license
to
run
a
gambling
establishment
in
1948
and
did
not
regain
it
until
April
13
,
1950
.
He
was
not
granted
a
license
to
open
the
Horseshoe
Casino
until
December
5
,
1952
.
Fischer
believes
that
the
notion
of
Binion
sponsoring
a
poker
game
,
in
front
of
a
window
,
of
a
casino
that
has
n't
opened
,
while
fighting
extradition
is
``
absurd
.

Ubaoner
appears
only
in

story
of
the
Westcar
Papyrus
--
there
is
no
or
historical	B	historical	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History
evidence
that
he
existed
.
Nevertheless
he
is
an
object
of
great
interest
for
,
since
his
magical
trick
is
connected
to
later
cultural
perceptions
of
the
personality
of
king
Nebka
.
In
the
story
,
Ubaoner
is
described
as
a
high
lector
priest
.


According
to
the
Westcar
Papyrus
,
Ubaoner
is
betrayed
by
his
own
wife
several
times
.
She
secretly
loves
a
commoner
who
resides
at
Memphis	B	Memphis	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Egypt
and
sends
him
expensive
clothes
and
other
material
.
The
commoner
comes
to
visit
Ubaoner
's
wife
and
says
to
her
:
``
Is
n't
there
a
pavilion	B	pavilion	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavilion
at
the
lake
?
''
The
wife
says
:
``
See
,
let
's
spend
some
time
in
there
.
''
She
calls
for
Ubaoner
's
caretaker	B	caretaker	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_caretaker
and
orders
him
:
``
Prepare
the
pavilion
with
all
good
things
.
''
And
so
Ubaoner
's
wife
and
the
commoner
spend
their
time
in
the
pavilion
drinking
together
,
until
they
were
finished
.
Later
that
evening
the
commoner
is
picked
up
by
his
maidservant
,
who
was
waiting
at
the
lake
.
Ubaoner
's
caretaker
was
waiting
there
,
too
and
he
says
:
``
I
will
go
to
Ubaoner
.
''
Two
days
later
the
caretaker
tells
everything
to
Ubaoner
and
makes
the
comment
:
``
See
,
it
was
your
wife
who
spent
a
day
in
your
pavilion
;
she
was
together
with
that
commoner
you
know
.
It
was
adultery	B	adultery	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adultery
what
he
did
,
two
times
,
at
your
lake
.
''
Thereupon
,
Ubaoner
says
to
the
caretaker
:
``
Bring
me
a
pair
of
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
made
of
ebony	B	ebony	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebony
and
dja'am	B	dja'am	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrum
.
I
will
create
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
and
send
it
as
a
harbinger
.
''
He
creates
a
small
figurine
of
wax	B	wax	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax
in
the
shape
of
a
crocodile	B	crocodile	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile
with
a
length
of
seven
fingers
.
He
bewitches
the
figurine
and
gives
it
to
his
caretaker
with
the
words
:
``
When
he
comes
to
purify
himself
in
the
lake
,
this
commoner
,
then
you
may
throw
this
crocodile
made
of
wax
after
him
.
''
The
caretaker
does
as
ordered
and
waits
until
the
next
day
.
The
next
morning
Ubaoner
's
wife
orders
the
caretaker
:
``
Let
the
pavilion
at
the
lake
be
prepared
,
for
I
will
sit
in
it
.
''
Thereupon
she
spends
the
whole
day
in
the
pavilion
together
with
the
commoner
.
Later
that
evening
the
commoner
leaves
the
pavilion
to
take
a
bath
in
the
lake
.
The
caretaker
quickly
throws
the
wax
figurine
after
the
stranger
and
when
the
idol
touches
the
water
it
becomes
a
real
,
living
crocodile
3.70
m
in
length
.
The
animal
devours
the
commoner
and
disappears
in
the
depths
of
the
lake
for
seven
days
.
During
these
seven
days
Ubaoner
is
received
by
pharaoh
Nebka
for
an
important
audience
.
After
the
audience
Ubaoner
invites
Nebka
to
visit
his
house
with
the
words
:
``
May
thy
majesty
proceed
and
see
the
wonder
that
has
happened
in
the
time
of
thy
majesty
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
a
commoner
.
''
.
Nebka
and
Ubaoner
walk
to
the
lake
where
Ubaoner
orders
the
crocodile
to
come
out
of
the
water
and
to
release
the
commoner
.
When
king
Nebka
sees
that
he
says
:
``
This
crocodile
is
dangerous
!
''
But
Ubaoner
bends
down
and
touches
the
crocodile
and
immediately
it
becomes
a
figurine
of
wax
again
.
Then
Ubaoner
gives
a
report
to
Nebka
about
the
affairs
.
Nebka
tells
the
crocodile
:
``
Take
away
what
is
yours
!
''
and
the
animal
grabs
the
commoner
and
then
disappears
.
The
wife
of
Ubaoner
is
brought
to
Nebka
,
too
and
the
pharaoh
sentence
her
to
death
.
She
is

Gender
role
is
one
aspect
of
a
gender
binary
.
Many
societies
have
used
the
gender
binary
to
divide
and
organize
people
,
though
the
ways
this
happens
differs
between
societies
.
A
universal
aspect
of
the
gender
binaries
is
that
women
give
birth
.
Gender
binaries
exist
as
a
means
of
bringing
order
,
though

Voices
from

argue
that
gender
binaries
divide
and
polarize
society

often
used
as
authorities
for
the
justification
and
description
.
Islam	B	Islam	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam

Exceptions
have
widely
existed
to
the

binary
in
the

of
specific
transgender

.
Besides
the
biological
identification
of
intersex

elements

s
have
a
unique
place
in
relation
to
the
gender
binary
because
in
many
cases
their
gender
expression
transitions
from
one
side
of
the
gender
binary
to
the
other
but
still
conforms
to
the
gender
binary
itself
.


Many
scholars
have
contested
the
existence
of
a
clear
gender
binary
.
There
is
an
increasing
amount
of
research
that
illustrates
that
the
evidence
for
dividing
humans
into
the
two
distinct
categories
of
men
and
women
is
problematic
and
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy
.
For
example
,
Judith	B	Judith_Lorber	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Lorber
Lorber	I	Judith_Lorber	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Lorber
explains
the
problem
of
failing
to
question
dividing
people
into
these
two
groups
``
even
though
they
often
find
more
significant
within-group
differences
than
between-group
differences
.
''
Lorber
argues
that
this
corroborates
the
fact
that
the
gender
binary
is
quite
arbitrary
and
leads
to
false
expectations
of
both
genders
.
Instead
,
there
is
growing
support
for
the
possibility
of
utilizing
additional
categories
that
compare
people
without
``
prior
assumptions
about
who
is
like
whom
.
''
By
allowing
for
a
more
fluid
approach
to
gender
,
people
will
be
better
able
to
identify
themselves
however
they
choose
,
and
scholarly
research
will
find
different
similarities
and
differences
.


A
further
issue
with
the
gender
binary
is
the
insistence
that
men
are
and
women
are
.
This
reduces
options
for
people

The

based
on

perception
that
African

still
had
unique
issues

could
benefit
from
a
chance

Whereas
when

it
was
a
potential
resource
at
least
in
theory
for
issues
relating
to
black
members
throughout
the
United

,
under
its
current
existence
it
is
under
the
Utah
Salt
Lake
City
Area
with
designation
to
be
a
resource
throughout
all
three
Areas	B	Areas	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_(LDS_Church)
in
Utah
,
a
multi-area
system
facilitated
in
part
by
having
one
man
preside
over
all
three
areas
.
Genesis
Groups
formed
in
other
parts
of
the
United

would
either
be
under

more
likely
have
either

Seventy
assigned
to
that
area
or
an
as

priesthood
advisor
over
the

This
would

The
Hopewell
tradition
was
a
widely
dispersed
set
of
related
populations
,
which
were
connected
by
a
common
network
of
trade
routes
,
known
as
the
.
The
Marksville
culture
was
a
southern
manifestation
of
this
network
.
Settlements
were
large
and
usually
located
on
terraces
of
major
streams
.
Evidence
from
excavations
of
burial
mounds
from
this
period
suggest
they
were
constructed
for
persons
of
high
social
status
,
and
contained
grave
goods
of
imported
exotic
materials
such
as
copper	B	copper	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper

earspools
,
bracelets
and

figurines
,
marine
shells
,
freshwater
pearls
,
and
greenstone	B	greenstone	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenstone_(archaeology)
celts
.
The
pipes
had
flat
bases
with
a
hole
for
a
stem
,
and
a
bowl
in
the
center
.
Animal
figurines
on
the
platform
are
n't
unusual
,
with
the
bowl
being
located
in
the
animal
's
back
.
The
high
status
leaders
organized
community
life
,
and
officiated
at
burial
ceremonies
,
an
important
part
of
the
Marksville
Culture
.
The
mounds
were
constructed
in
stages
over
many
years
,
with
the
first
stage
being
a
flat
,
low
platform
.
The
ceremonies
may
have
been
held
years
apart
and
those
who
died
between
ceremonies
were
temporarily
stored
in
other
locations
,
then
gathered
up
and
buried
together
.


Although
made
from
local
clay
,
Marksville
pottery
was
similar
in
design
and
decoration
to
pottery
found
in
Illinois
and
Ohio
.
A
typical
vessel
was
three
to
five
inches
tall
and
three
to
seven
inches
in
diameter
and
often
decorated
with
geometric
and
effigy
designs
,
usually
stylized
birds
.
This
decorated
pottery
was
made
primarily
for
ceremonial
uses
,
with
other
plainer
utilitarian
ware
for
daily
use
.
Marksville
pottery
influenced
Santa

,
on
condition
that
the
Scottish
system

church

was

as
many

others
preferred

After
some
haggling
a
document
called
``
The

League

was
drawn
up

This
was
in

a
treaty

the
preservation
of

in

the
reformation

the
word
of

,
and
the
extirpation
of

.

did
not

another

faction

,
and
,
with
some
slight
modifications
,
by
the
Westminster
.
This
agreement
meant
that
the
Covenanters
sent
another
army
south
to
England
to
fight
on
the
Parliamentarian
side
in
the
First

Civil
War

Ethylene

and
heparin
are
commonly
used
in

(

to
prevent

.


At
one
time
,
fairly
early
in
the
research
for
diabetes
treatment
by
transplantation
,
Ficoll
was
used
in
an
attempt
to
separate
islets	B	islets_of_Langerhans	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans
of	I	islets_of_Langerhans	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans
Langerhans	I	islets_of_Langerhans	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islets_of_Langerhans
from
enzyme
(
collagenase
)
digested
human
pancreatic
tissue
.
The
theory
was
that
separated
islets
could
then
be
used
for
transplantation
into
patients
with
.
In
practice
,
using
Ficoll
led
to
difficulty
obtaining
a
pure
enough
preparation
of
islets
,
with
enough
islet
recovery
from
the
original
tissue
,
for
safe
and
effective
islet
transplantation
in
humans
.


Because
Ficoll-Paque
layering
is
a
very
slow
process
,
devices
that
aid
in
the
most
time-consuming
step
,
the
overlay
,
have
been
developed
.
One
such
a
product
is
SepMate-50
,
a
specialized
tube
containing
a
porous
insert
that
forms
a
physical
barrier
between
the
Ficoll-Paque
and
blood
sample
.
This
allows
the
blood
sample
to
be
rapidly
pipetted
onto
the
insert
,
avoiding
the
need
for
overlaying
it
directly
onto
Ficoll-Paque
.
The
SepMate
insert
also
reduces
the
duration
of
the
centrifugation
step
,
and
after
centrifugation
,
the
top
layer
containing
plasma
and
PBMCs
can
be
poured
into
a
new
tube
.
Other
devices
include
a
column
containing
a
porous
high-density
polyethylene	B	polyethylene	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene
barrier
or
``
frit
.
''
These
products
allow
blood
to
be
layered
on
much
more
quickly
without
mixing
polysaccharide
and
blood
.
An
example
of
such
a
product
is
the
``
Accuspin

The

Nelsonic
Industries
is
the
name
of
an
electronics
manufacturing
and
development
company
that
operated
from

York	I	New_York_City	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City
City	I	New_York_City	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City
)
in
the
early
1980s
and
throughout
the
1990s
when
it
was
acquired
by
the
watch-manufacturer
,
M.Z.
Berger
.
Nelsonic
produced
numerous
toy-themed
wrist-watches
during
their
existence
,
often
targeting
younger
audiences
with
likenesses
of
characters
from
popular
franchises
such
as
Barbie	B	Barbie	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie
,
the
Ghostbusters	B	Ghostbusters	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters
,
Mario	B	Mario	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario
,
and
.
Nelsonic
became
notable
during
the
early
mid-1980s
for
being
the
first
electronics
company
in
the
United
States
to
produce
game-watches
(
multi-purpose
electronic
devices
capable
of
functioning
as
both
a
time-piece
and
as
a
typically
electronic
game
)
.
For
a
period
subsequent
to
its
purchase
by
M.Z.
Berger
,
Nelsonic
operated
as
a
subsidiary
division
of
its
parent
company
and
game-watches
were
produced
that
bore
the
Nelsonic
mark
.
This
practice
ended
as
M.Z.
Berger
shifted
focus
to
more
traditional
and
higher-end
timepieces
.
Today
the
original
Nelsonic
Game
Watch
line
has
entered
the
secondary
market
and
individual
Game
Watches
have
become
highly
sought-after
collectibles
that
often
fetch
high
prices
on
eBay
and
other
online
auction
websites
.


Throughout
its
existence
,
Nelsonic
produced
pop-culture-themed
wrist-watches
for
children
and
young
adults
.
The
chronograph
digital
watches
,
typically
made
of
molded
plastic
,
invariably
featured
an
alarm
and
utilized
display-screens
to
display
the
time
for
their
wearers
.
In
time
the
company
began
manufacturing
multi-purpose
units
that
used
the
LCD
screen
to
combine
time
display
functions
with
simple
video
game
functions
.
These
simple
video
games
were
variations
on
the
theme
of
the
Calculator	B	Calculator_watch	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator_watch
watch	I	Calculator_watch	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator_watch
,
and
the
patent
covering
the
Game
Watch
line
is
in
fact
classified
as
an
``
electronic
calculator
watch
structure
.
''
Becoming
the
first
electronics
manufacturer
in
the
United
States
to
produce
game-watches
,
Nelsonic
earned
a
large
share
in
this
specialized
market
and
was
able
to
earn
the
attention
of
large
video
game
companies
at
events
such
as
the
.
Having
caught
the
popular
attention
and
with
goodwill
at
a
high-point
,
Nelsonic
was
able
to
obtain
licensing
from
several
big-name
video
game
companies
such
as
Sega	B	Sega	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega
,
Nintendo	B	Nintendo	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo
,
Midway	B	Midway_Games	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Games
Games	I	Midway_Games	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Games
,
and
Mylstar
Electronics
.
With
roots
in
the
toy
market
,
Nelsonic
was
also
able
to
obtain
similar
licenses
to
produce
LCD
versions
of
popular
electronic
toys
like
Milton	B	Milton_Bradley	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Bradley_Company
Bradley	I	Milton_Bradley	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Bradley_Company
's
Simon	B	Simon	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)
as
well
as
to
produce
original
LCD
games
for
non-game
toy
franchises
like
Barbie	B	Barbie	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie
,
G.I.	B	G.I._Joe	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Joe
Joe	I	G.I._Joe	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Joe
,
and
Power	B	Power_Rangers	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Rangers
Rangers	I	Power_Rangers	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Rangers
and
even
for
film
and
TV
franchises
such
as
Ghostbusters	B	Ghostbusters	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters
.
So
well-known
became
the
Nelsonic
brand
that
it
was
even
able
to
license
its
own
original
games
(
such
as
the
Nelsonic
version
of
the
public-domain
blackjack	B	blackjack	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack
which
was
licensed
to
Caesars	B	Caesars_Palace	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesars_Palace
Palace	I	Caesars_Palace	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesars_Palace
)
.


As
time
progressed
,
Nelsonic
experimented
with
higher-end
products
such
as
metal
watches
and
increasingly
complex
game-watch
designs
.
In
1990
the
watch-making
giant
,
M.Z.
Berger
,
made
a
large
bid
and
was
able
to
successfully
purchase
the
company
.
For
a
period
of
nearly
a
decade
after
this
acquisition
,
M.Z.
Berger
continued
to
use
Nelsonic
as
a
subsidiary
branch
and
to
employ
the
Nelsonic
mark
in
the
release
of
game-watches
and
the
production
of
new
re-releases
of
popular
models
from
the
1980s
and
early
1990s
.
By
the
end
of
the
1990s
,
however
,
public
interest
had
waned
(
quite
possibly
due
to
the
rise
in
popularity
of
more
advanced
s
and
,
eventually
,
of
other
portable
computing
devices
,
such
as
s
and
)
and
this
practice
came
to
an
end
as
M.Z.
Berger
shifted
markets
to
target
higher
end
consumers
more
exclusively
.


Today
the
Nelsonic
mark
is
still
in
use
for
traditional
watches
and
is
not
used
in
connection
with
game-watches
.
It
is
still
a
subsidiary
of
M.Z.
Berger
and

This

was
widely
seen
in
the
Arab	B	Arab_world	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world
world	I	Arab_world	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world
as
an
abandonment
of

of
non-recognition
of
Israel
,
and
as
breaking
the
Arab
alliance
against
Israel
.
It
was
generally
condemned
as
treachery
.


The

affirmed
its
rejection
of
resolutions
and

and
reiterated
the
unwillingness
to
recognize
Israel
or
negotiate
with
it
for

It
also
called
for

condemned
every
Arab
government
who
did
not
take
part
of
the
Front
,
and
emphasized
the
ties
between
Syria
and
the
Palestinians
.
Still
,
interestingly
,
it
did
not
explicitly
call
for
Israel

destruction

but
instead
repeated
the
of
the
PLO

calling
for
a
Palestinian

land
...
as
an
interim
aim
of
the
Palestinian
Revolution	B	Revolution	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution
''
.
This
had
been
interpreted
,
at
least
inside
the

,
as
a
step
towards
a
two-state	B	two-state_solution	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution

and

The
name

comes
from
the
word
Cheti
in
their
own
language
,
meaning
``
close
to
the

The

are

between

1000

.
They
had

They
were
the
most

The

cooked
on

with
simple

,
and
were
culturally
very
similar
to
the
tribe
to
the
south
,
``
who
shared
the

The

is
thought
to
have
had
perhaps
one
thousand
members
at
its
peak
,
but
its
numbers
declined
after
European-American
settlers
came
into

Settlers
destroyed

.


After
earning
his
MS
from
MIT
,
Hunter
went
to
work
for
the
Douglas
Aircraft
Company
.
He
became
their
chief
designer
in
aeronautics
,
working
on
modifications
of
the
B-42
and
B-43
bombers
.
Later
he
was
promoted
to
chief
engineer
for
space

.
In
this
position
he
oversaw
the
production
of
military
missiles
including
the
Honest
John
artillery
rocket
,
the
Nike
antiaircraft
missile
,
and
the
Sparrow

began
work
on
the
Thor	B	Thor	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGM-17_Thor
,
an
early

IRBM
)
,
in
late
1955
and
put
Hunter
in
charge
of
that
program
.
He
assembled
a
small
team
of
crack
designers
and
brought
the
development
to
success
in
a
short
time
.
Thor
became
the
basis
of
the
McDonnell	B	McDonnell_Douglas	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas

,
whose
descendants
are
still
boosting
payloads
into

today
.


After
working
for
Douglas
Aircraft
from
1944
to
1961
,
Hunter
joined
the
staff
of
the
,
a
group
that
advised
the
U.S.
president
on
space
policy
.
Following
several
years
in
that
position
,
he
went
back
to
the
aerospace
industry
in
1965
,
spending
over
two
decades
with
Lockheed
Missiles
and
Space
Company
(
LMSC
)

division

parts
of

.
SDI
gave
him
a
chance
at
realizing
a
dream
he
had
nurtured
since
the
1960s
:
the
construction
of
a
Single-stage-to-orbit	B	Single-stage-to-orbit	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-stage-to-orbit
(
SSTO
)
vehicle
.
In
1984
,
Hunter
proposed
a
vehicle
he
called
the
X-rocket
,
based
on
those
earlier
SSTO
designs
.
The
design
was
reviewed
by
LMSC
's
Astronautics
Division
(
AD
)
,
which
judged
it
worth
pursuing
,
and
by
its
Missile
Systems
Division
(
MSD
)
,
which
did
not
.


LMSC
then
declined
to
support
further
work
on
the
X-rocket
,
and
Hunter
retired
.
As
an
independent
consultant
,
he
renamed
the
concept
SSX
(
for
Space
Ship
Experimental
)
,
and
began
to
refine
it
.
In
December
1988
the
ad
hoc
was
briefed
on
the
concept
by
Hunter
and
others
.
The
general
concept
was
endorsed
by
the
Council
and
by
High
Frontier
,
Inc.
,
a
Washington-based
group
headed
by
Lt.
Gen.
Daniel	B	Daniel_O._Graham	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_O._Graham
O.	I	Daniel_O._Graham	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_O._Graham
Graham	I	Daniel_O._Graham	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_O._Graham
that
lobbied
for
SDI
programs
.
Working
together
,
Hunter
and
High
Frontier
convinced
SDI
management
and
other
national
officials
that
a
study
should
be
initiated
to
determine
once
and
for
all
the
feasibility
of
SSTO
vehicles
for
military
missions
.


This
led
to
a
U.S.
Department
of
Defense
(
DoD
)
program
to
design
a
single-stage
vehicle
that
could
replace
military
satellites
on
short
notice
during
a
national
emergency
.
This
vehicle
was
known
as
the
Delta
Clipper
.
McDonnell	B	McDonnell_Douglas	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas
Douglas	I	McDonnell_Douglas	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas
Corporation
was
contracted
to
build
and
test
fly
a
one-third-scale
,
suborbital
testbed
called
the
DC-X	B	DC-X	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-X
,
or
Delta
Clipper
Experimental
.
While
not
capable
of
spaceflight
,
the
DC-X
incorporated
many
of
the
technologies
needed
for
an
SSTO
vehicle
,
including
highly
automated
systems
enabling
a
quick
turnaround
(
just
twenty-six
hours
)
between
launches
.
It
made
eight
successful
test
flights
between
August
18
,
1993
,
and
July
7
,
1995
,
and
then
was
taken
over
by
NASA
and
flown
four
times
as
the
DC-XA
between
May
18
and
July
31
,
1996
.
It
was
damaged
on
its
last
flight
when
one
landing
strut
failed
to
deploy
and
the
vehicle
tipped
over
at
landing
.
Funding
to
make
repairs
and
continue
flight
tests
was
not
made
available
.


Max
Hunter
continued
to
advise
on
space
policy
issues
and
advocate
the
building
of
SSTO
vehicles
for
airline-like
access
to
space
,
a
goal
he
was
sure
could
be
attained
.
He

the
first
reusable

to
reach
space
twice
within
two
weeks
without
substantial
refit

In
October
2000
,
he
agreed
to
serve
as
Chairman
of
the
Advisory
Board
for
the
Undersea

The
nucleoid
(
meaning
nucleus	B	nucleus	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus
-

)
is
an
irregularly-shaped
region
within
the
cell	B	cell	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)
of
a
prokaryote	B	prokaryote	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote
that
contains
all
or
most
of
the
genetic	B	genetic_material	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome
material	I	genetic_material	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome
.
In
contrast
to
the
nucleus	B	nucleus	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus
of
a
eukaryotic	B	eukaryotic	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote
cell

it
is
not
surrounded
by
a
nuclear	B	nuclear_membrane	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_membrane
membrane	I	nuclear_membrane	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_membrane
.
The
genome	B	genome	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome
of
prokaryotic
organisms
generally
is
a
circular
,
double-stranded
piece
of
DNA	B	DNA	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA
,
of
which
multiple
copies
may
exist
at
any
time
.
The
length
of
a
genome
widely
varies
,
but
generally
is
at
least
a
few
million
base
pairs
.


A
genophore
is
the
DNA
of
a
prokaryote
.
It
is
commonly
referred
to
as
a
prokaryotic
chromosome	B	chromosome	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome
.
The
term
``
chromosome
''
is
misleading
for
a
genophore
because
the
genophore
lacks
chromatin	B	chromatin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin
.
The
genophore
is
compacted
through
a
mechanism
known
as
,
whereas
a
chromosome
is
additionally
compacted
via
chromatin
.
The
genophore
is
circular
in
most
prokaryotes
,
and
linear
in
very
few
.
The
circular
nature
of
the
genophore
allows
replication
to
occur
without
.
Genophores
are
generally
of
a
much
smaller
size
than
Eukaryotic
chromosomes
.
A
genophore
can
be
as
small
as
580,073
base
pairs
(
Mycoplasma	B	Mycoplasma_genitalium	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_genitalium
genitalium	I	Mycoplasma_genitalium	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_genitalium
)
.
Many
eukaryotes
(
such
as
plants
and
animals
)
carry
genophores
in
organelles
such
as
and
.
These
organelles
are
very
similar
to
true
prokaryotes

The
nucleoid
can
be
clearly
visualized
on
an
at
high
magnification	B	magnification	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnification

,
although
its
appearance
may
differ
,
it
is
clearly
visible
against
the
cytosol	B	cytosol	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosol
.
Sometimes
even
strands
of
what
is
thought
to
be
DNA
are
visible
.
By
staining
with
the
Feulgen	B	Feulgen_stain	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feulgen_stain
stain	I	Feulgen_stain	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feulgen_stain
,
which
specifically
stains
DNA
,
the
nucleoid
can
also
be
seen
under
a
light
microscope
.
The
DNA-intercalating
stains
DAPI	B	DAPI	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAPI
and
ethidium	B	ethidium_bromide	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethidium_bromide
bromide	I	ethidium_bromide	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethidium_bromide
are
widely
used
for
of
nucleoids
.


Experimental
evidence
suggests
that
the
nucleoid
is
largely
composed
of
DNA
,
about
60
%
,
with
a
small
amount
of
RNA	B	RNA	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA
and
protein	B	protein	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein

The
latter
two

are
likely
to

With
the
themes
of
her
writing
and
her

name
she
profited
from
the
German
interest
for
Scandinavian
writers
.


Born
the

woman
in
Karlskrona
and
brought
up

,
she

up
to
her
twelfth
year
.
It
was
only
after

,
from
about

)
in
order
to
learn
the
German
language
.
On
April
17th
1905
she
married
,
in
Växjö
,
the
son
of
her
teacher
,
15
years
her
senior
,
and
in
1906
gave
birth
to
their
son
Gustav
Adolf
.
She
got
divorced
in
1909
after
she
had
been
left
by
her
husband
.
Nordström
returned
to
Växjö
for
a
short
time
and
in
the
same
year
moved
to
Berlin	B	Berlin	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin
to
become
a
photographer
.
After
three
years
of
instruction
and
practical
training
,
she
had
to
give
up
her
profession
for
health
reasons
.
In
1912
she
went
to
Munich	B	Munich	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich
to
become
a
writer
.
It
was
there
that
in
1914
she
met
Siegfried
von
Vegesack
,
whom
she
married
on
February
16th
in
Stockholm	B	Stockholm	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm
.


In

husband
to
Berlin
,
where
in
April
1917
her
daughter
Isabel
was
born
(
who
died
in
2005
)
.
Because
of
an
ailment
of
Siegfried
von

,
the
family
in
1917
moved
to
a
farm
near
Dingolfing	B	Dingolfing	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingolfing
and
later
to
Großwalding
near
Deggendorf	B	Deggendorf	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deggendorf
.
In
1918
they
acquired
a
corn
tower
near
Regen	B	Regen	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regen
,
which
they
refurbished
into
a
residential
tower
.
In
1920
Karin
their
second
daughter
was
born
but
died
only
a
few
days
later

In
1923
their

to
be
killed

In
the
same
year
Nordström
published
her
first
novel
``
Tomtelilla
''
both
in
Germany
and
in
Sweden
.
With
her
mother
's
death
an
important
source
of
income
had
run
dry
.
Therefore
,
Nordström
opened
up
,
in
the
tower
,
a
place
for
artists
and
writers
to
live
.
In
these
years
the
couple
started
gradually
to
grow
apart
.
In
1929
the
family
moved
to
Switzerland
.
Shortly
afterwards
Clara
Nordström
moved
with
her
children
to
Stuttgart	B	Stuttgart	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart
and
got
a
divorce
in
1935
at
Vegesack
's
wish
.
In
that
year
she
started
to
read
from
her
works
all
over
Germany
.


From
her
German
base
,
she
also
wrote
articles
in
the
Swedish
press
.
In
1936
she
returned
for
a
short
period
to
the
residential
tower
in

Throughout
her
life
she
again

again
had
to
struggle
with
severe
ailments
and
therefore
intensely
questioned
her
faith
,
which
is
what
the

books
do

In

she
converted
from
Protestantism
to

.
He
became
a
violinist
,
and
taught
music
at
a
conservatory
in
Yerevan
.
In
the
early
1970s
he
learned
about
the
art
of
microminiature
from
one
of
his
students
,
Eduard
Ghazaryan
.
Sandaldjian
emigrated
to
the
United
States
in
1980
,
but
was
required
to
leave
behind
his
first
collection
of
18
miniature
works
.
Over
the
next
decade
,
he
produced
another
33
miniatures
.


Working
extremely
slowly
under
a
microscope
,
Sandaldjian
employed
self-made
tools
such
as
sharpened
needles
tipped
with
ruby
or
diamond
dust
,
compiling
his
sculptures
out
of
minuscule
materials
such
as
dust
,
lint
,
and
hair
.
Even
among
the
few
practitioners
of
microminiature
art
,
Sandaldjian
was
unusual
in
that
he
painted
his
work
,
using
a
single
sharpened
strand
of
hair
as
a
brush
.
Sandaldjian
would
time
his
motions
to
come
between
his
heartbeats
,
thus
maximizing
his
control
of
his
fingers
.
Those
who
saw
Sandaldjian
at
work
said
that
they
could
not
tell
when
his
hands
moved
.
