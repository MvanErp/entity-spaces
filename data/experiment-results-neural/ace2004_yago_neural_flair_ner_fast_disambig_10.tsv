Robinson				David_Robinson_(basketball)
of				
the				
IMF				International_Monetary_Fund
was				
similarly				
wary				
about				
next				
year				
.				
In				
October				
,				
the

projected				
that				
the

economy				
would				
grow				
4.2				
percent				
in				
2001

while				
Asia				Asia
as				
a				
region				
would				
grow				
6.6				
percent				
.				
On				
Friday				
,				
Robinson				David_Robinson_(basketball)
said				
the				
growth				
rate				
could				
be				
lower				
,				
though				
he				
would				
not				
say				
by				
how				
much				
.				
A				
principal				
culprit				
of				
possibly				
slower				
growth				
is				
the				
dependence				
of				
many				
Asian				Asia
countries				
on				
imported				
oil				
.				
Oil				
prices				
have				
risen

outlook

.				
Asia				Asia
has				
little				
control				
over				
oil				
,				
but				
Robinson				David_Robinson_(basketball)
said				
the				
region				
could				
improve				
its				
economic				
prospects				
by				
calming				
its				
political				
waters				
.				
One				
bright				
spot				
in				
the				
Asian				Asia
landscape				
is				
China				China

which				
is				
on				
track				
to				
record				
8				
percent				
growth				
in				
2000				
.				
Robinson				David_Robinson_(basketball)
said				
the				
main				
question				
facing				
Chinese				China
leaders				
was				
whether				
they				
need				
to				
spend				
billions				
of				
dollars				
in				
public				
funds				
to				
further				
stimulate				
an				
economy				
that				
was				
already				
expanding

today				
that

Coal				
,

,

However				
,				
using

has				
advantages

generation				
efficiency

lower

,				
is				
beneficial				
to				
the				
environment

etc.				
.				
According				
to				
presentations				
,				
with				
this				
type				
of				
electricity				
generation				
method				
,				
a				
single				
engine				
with				
liquefied				
natural				
gas				
as				
fuel				
can				
produce				
waste				
gas				
with				
temperatures				
being				
as				
high				
as				
500				
to				
600				
degrees				
centigrade				
.				
This				
gas				
in

can				
heat				
a				
boiler				
for				
the				
production				
of				
steam				
to				
turn

Because

the				
efficiency				
of				
this				
construction				
method				
,				
the				
electricity				
generated				
is				
relatively				
competitive				
in				
price				
.				
At				
the

time

using

take				
over

eventually				
to				
declare

the				
winner

wins				
the

.				
But				
lawyers				
for				
Gov.				
George				George_W._Bush
W.				George_W._Bush
Bush				George_W._Bush
said				
they				
had				
no				
intention				
of				
allowing				
any				
hand				
counting				
to				
begin				
without				
a				
vigorous				
legal				
fight				
.				
To				
that				
end				
,				
they				
persuaded

to				
order

brought				
up				
from

placed				
in

custody

That				
represents				
83				
times				
the				
number				
of				
disputed				
ballots				
that				
the				
judge				
had				
agreed				
on				
Tuesday				
to				
transport				
to				
Tallahassee				Tallahassee,_Florida
at				
the				
Gore				Al_Gore
team				
's				
request				
.				
And				
it				
could				
take				
weeks				
if				
not				
months				
to				
count				
them				
all				
,				
the				
point				
that				
Barry

,

chief				
trial				
lawyer				
here

was

that

we				
do

in

we				
wanted

''				
Aware				
that				
they				
could				
not				
stop				
the				
movement				
of				
all				
the				
ballots				
,				
Gore				Al_Gore
's				
lawyers				
barely				
objected				
to				
the				
move				
,				
asking				
only				
that				
the				
disputed				
ballots				
that

''				
The				
decision				
by				
Gore				Al_Gore
's				
lawyers				
to				
appeal				
the				
case				
shows				
how				
perilous				
their				
situation				
is				
.				
By				
appealing				
,				
the				
lawyers				
were				
forced				
to				
put				
on				
paper				
their				
fear				
that				
their				
case				
could				
be				
over				
if				
they				
can				
not				
begin

until

The				
decision				
to				
wait				
until				
a				
Saturday				
hearing				
``				
is				
effectively				
a

said				
the

filed				
with				
the

of				Appellate_court

It				
adds				
,				
``

But				
the

since

hunting				
began				
in

there				
had				
been				
seven				
shooting				
accidents				
linked				
to				
the				
practice				
.				
Three				
were				
fatal

Two

More				
than				
750,000				
licensed				
hunters				
are				
taking				
to				
the				
Michigan				Michigan
woods				
this				
year				
,				
where				
they				
are				
expected				
to				
kill				
about				
500,000				
of				
the				
state				
's				
1.9				
million				
deer				
.				
The				
numbers				
reinforce				
the				
need				
to				
improve				
education				
about				
platform				
hunting				
with				
firearms				
,				
Koppelo				
said				
.				
The				
practice				
is				
more				
commonly				
associated				
with				
hunters				
using				
bows				
and				
arrows				
.				
Instead				
of				
hiding				
on				
the				
ground				
or				
walking				
through				
the				
woods				
,				
they				
wait				
quietly				
,				
typically				
at				
a				
height				
of				
15				
to				
20				
feet				
,				
and				
fire				
down				
at				
deer				
that				
wander				
below				
.

hunter				
killed

coordinator

says				
the				
practice				
does				
offer				
one				
safety				
advantage				
:				
errant				
shots				
typically				
thump				
harmlessly				
to				
the				
ground				
,				
rather				
than				
whistling				
through				
the				
woods				
and				
striking				
other				
people				
.				
The				
problems				
primarily				
arise				
when				
hunters				
get				
in				
and				
out				
of				
position

the

following

were				
trying				
to				
keep				
count				
of				
these				
injuries

that				
it

difficult

He				
says

in

probably				
felt				
the				
circumstances				
were				
such				
that				
they				
had				
no				
real				
alternative				
but				
to				
take				
the				
case				
.				
Well				
,				
I				
think				
they				
took				
the				
case				
because				
it				
seemed				
like				
it				
was				
such				
a				
important				
issue				
that				
it				
would				
be				
kind				
of				
unseemly				
for				
them				
to				
try				
to				
reject				
it				
out

In

I

tomorrow				
,				
is				
going				
to				
ask				
the				
court				
to				
hold				
the				
case				
,				
moot				
and				
dismiss				
it				
.				
And				
the				
Bush				George_W._Bush
campaign				
has				
brought				
the				
case				
,				
but				
recognizes				
that				
the				
particular				
issues				
that				
they				
brought				
to				
the				
court				
last				
week				
are				
really				
not				
very				
relevant				
anymore				
.				
They				
are				
going				
to				
probably				
,				
well				
,				
I				
know				
what				
they				
are				
going				
to				
do				
.				
They				
are				
going				
to				
try				
to				
broaden				
the				
case				
to				
make				
it				
a				
kind				
of				
a				
general				
referendum				
on				
election				
procedures				
.				
So				
,				
they				
are				
looking				
for				
a				
coronation				
.				
And				
the				
Gore				Al_Gore
people				
at				
this				
point				
just				
want				
to				
get				
rid				
of				
this				
case				
,				
because				
they				
think				
they				
have				
a				
better				
chance				
in				
the				
Florida				Florida
courts				
.				
Republicans				Republican_Party_(United_States)
generally				
support				
states				
'				
rights				
.				
So				
,				
does				
it				
appear				
somewhat				
ironic				
that				
they				
are				
going				
to				
the				
Supreme				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
Court				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
in				
this				
instance				
?				
No				
,				
I				
think				
first				
of				
all				
the				
notion				
that				
Republicans				Republican_Party_(United_States)
favor				
states				
'				
rights				
and				
Democrats				Democratic_Party_(United_States)
oppose				
it				
,				
is				
much				
too				
simplistic				
.				
That				
's				
generally				
true				
,				
but				
it				
's				
only				
true				
on				
some				
issues				
.				
And				
in				
this				
case				
,				
you				
could				
argue				
that				
the				
Bush				George_W._Bush
people				
are				
going				
to				
the				
Supreme				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
Court				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
to				
preserve				
the				
right				
of				
Florida				Florida
,				
to				
determine				
its				
own				
electors				
.				
So				
,				
there				
is				
a				
kind				
of				
states				
'				
rights				
issue				
there				
.				
But				
they				
need				
,				
or				
at				
least				
they				
once				
thought				
they				
needed				
the				
Supreme				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
Court				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
to				
endorse				
it				
.				
So				
it				
goes				
both				
ways				
.				
What				
are				
the				
justices				
likely				
looking				
for				
?				
Well				
,				
I				
do				
n't				
know				
.				
But				
I				
think				
that				
-				
and				
I				
think				
they				
will				
be				
divided				
,				
I				
mean				
I				
do				
n't				
think				
they				
will				
be				
unanimous				
.				
Obviously				
,				
they				
would				
like				
to				
be				
able				
to				
achieve				
some				
kind				
of				
resolution				
of				
the				
case				
.				
American				United_States
election				
laws				
are				
often				
challenged				
at				
the				
local				
level				
and				
sometimes				
in				
the				
Federal				Federal_government_of_the_United_States
courts				
,				
but				
this				
is				
certainly				
the				
first				
time				
we				
have				
had				
a				
Supreme				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
Court				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
challenge				
over				
presidential				
election				
.				
So				
,				
there				
is				
a				
lot				
of				
new				
law				
here				
to				
be				
made				
or				
at				
least				
law				
that				
has				
n't				
been				
made				
yet				
.				
It				
's				
possible				
that				
if				
the				
court				
accepts				
the				
invitation				
of				
the				
Bush				George_W._Bush
campaign				
,				
at				
least				
as				
it				
is				
expressed				
in				
the				
briefs				
they				
submitted				
yesterday				
,				
that				
the				
court				
will				
in				
the				
sense				
,				
take				
the				
entire				
issue				
,				
even				
-				
not				
just				
the				
specific				
questions				
that				
it				
was				
asked				
last				
week				
and				
try				
to				
resolve				
the				
question				
.				
For				
example				
,				
if				
the				
court				
says				
it				
is				
clearly				
the				
fact				
that				
the				
legislature	B	legislature	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Legislature	
of				
the				
state				
of				
Florida				Florida
can				
determine				
for				
itself				
who				
its				
electors				
will				
be				
,				
that				
will				
pretty				
much				
end				
the				
case				
,				
because				
that				
's				
what				
the				
legislature				
already				
plans				
to				
do				
.				
And				
that				
does				
n't				
mean				
the				
Gore				Al_Gore
people				
wo				
n't				
keep				
trying				
,				
because				
ultimately				
Congress	B	Congress	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress	United_States_Congress
has				
to				
decide				
and				
only				
Congress				United_States_Congress

Back				
in				
January				
,				
when				
Internet				Internet
stocks				
were				
hot				
,				
America				AOL
Online				AOL
agreed				
to				
buy				
Time				Time_Warner
Warner				Time_Warner
with				
AOL				AOL
stock				
.				
The				
deal				
,				
if				
approved				
by				
regulators				
,				
would				
leave				
AOL				AOL
shareholders				
with				
55				
percent				
of				
the				
merged				
company				
,				
even				
though				
Time				Time_Warner
Warner				Time_Warner
's				
revenue				
and				
cash				
flow				
are				
far				
greater				
.				
Since				
then				
,				
AOL				AOL
's				
stock				
has				
fallen				
by				
almost				
a				
third

destroying				
most				
of

conclude				
that

His

also				
an
