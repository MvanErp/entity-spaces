The				
Chinese				China

said				
the				
feathers				
have				
some				
of				
the				
characteristics				
of

,				
but				
the				
structure				
is				
more				
primitive				
than				
feathers				
found				
on				
Archaeopteryx				Archaeopteryx
,				
the				
earliest				
known				
bird				
.				
				
Archaeopteryx				Archaeopteryx
appeared				
about				
145				
million				
years				
ago				
,				
while				
Protopteryx				
was				
dated				
as				
more				
recent				
,				
about				
120				
million				
years				
ago

Microraptor				Microraptor

which				
was				
about				
the				
size				
of				
a				
crow				
,				
lived				
about				
125				
million				
years				
ago				
.				
				
Some				
elements				
of				
the				
Protopteryx				
wing				
bone				
and				
muscle				
structure				
match				
those				
of				
modern				
birds				
,				
said				
Zhang				Zhang_(disambiguation)

Zhou				Zhou_(disambiguation)
,				
but				
the				
wing				
retains				
a				
claw				
found				
on				
some				
primitive				
birdlike				
animals				
.				
In				
modern				
birds				
,				
that				
claw				
has				
disappeared				
and				
been				
replaced				
with				
a				
structure				
that				
adds				
lift				
to				
the				
wing				
.				
				
Nonetheless				
,				
Protopteryx				
is				
thought				
to				
have				
been				
a				
competent				
flier				
.				
				
Most				
dinosaur				
researchers				
believe				
birds				
evolved				
150				
to				
180				
million				
years				
ago				
from				
a				
dinosaur				
group				
called				
Theropods				Theropoda

theory

The				
evolution				
of				
feathers				
,				
however				
,				
has				
been				
less				
clear				
.				
				
Some				
experts				
believe				
feathers				
evolved				
specifically				
to				
support				
flight				
,				
while				
others				
say				
feathers				
evolved				
first				
to				
provide				
warmth

protection

Fossils

images				
that				
some				
say				
could				
be				
the				
early				
precursors

But				
Feduccia				Alan_Feduccia
dismisses				
the				
theropod				
hair				
as

`				
dino

the

How				
the

today				
that				
if

water				
,

etc				
.				
,				
are				
normally				
used

However				
,				
using				
liquefied				
natural				
gas				
as				
fuel				
for				
joint				
circulatory				
electricity				
generation				
has				
advantages				
of				
higher				
power				
generation				
efficiency				
and				
lower				
total				
cost				
,				
is				
beneficial				
to				
the				
environment				
,				
etc				
.				
				
According				
to				
presentations				
,				
with				
this				
type				
of				
electricity				
generation				
method				
,				
a				
single				
engine				
with				
liquefied				
natural				
gas				
as				
fuel				
can				
produce				
waste				
gas				
with				
temperatures				
being				
as				
high				
as				
500				
to				
600				
degrees				
centigrade				
.				
				
This				
gas				
in				
turn				
can				
heat				
a				
boiler				
for				
the				
production				
of				
steam				
to				
turn				
a				
steam				
turbine				
which				
generates				
electricity				
.				
				
Because				
of				
the				
efficiency				
of				
this				
construction				
method				
,				
the				
electricity				
generated				
is				
relatively				
competitive				
in				
price				
.				
At				
the				
same				
time				
,				
using				
natural				
gas				
as

will				
also				
reduce				
environmental				
pollution				
along

Robinson				David_Robinson_(basketball)
of

was				
similarly				
wary				
about				
next				
year				
.				
				
In				
October

the

4.2

would

On				
Friday

Robinson				David_Robinson_(basketball)

the				
growth				
rate				
could				
be				
lower				
,				
though				
he				
would				
not				
say				
by				
how				
much				
.				
				
A				
principal				
culprit				
of				
possibly				
slower				
growth				
is				
the				
dependence				
of				
many				
Asian				Asia
countries				
on				
imported				
oil

Asia				Asia

control

Robinson				David_Robinson_(basketball)
said				
the				
region				
could				
improve				
its				
economic				
prospects				
by				
calming				
its				
political				
waters

One

Robinson				David_Robinson_(basketball)

the				
main				
question				
facing

was				
whether				
they				
need				
to				
spend				
billions

dollars				
in

to				
further				
stimulate				
an				
economy

More				
than				
750,000

are				
taking				
to				
the

The				
numbers				
reinforce				
the				
need				
to				
improve				
education				
about

firearms				
,				
Koppelo				
said

The				
practice				
is				
more				
commonly				
associated				
with

using				
bows				
and				
arrows				
.				
Instead				
of				
hiding				
on				
the				
ground				
or				
walking				
through				
the				
woods				
,				
they				
wait				
quietly				
,				
typically				
at				
a				
height				
of				
15				
to				
20				
feet				
,				
and				
fire				
down				
at				
deer				
that				
wander				
below

does				
offer				
one				
safety				
advantage				
:				
errant

harmlessly				
to				
the				
ground				
,				
rather				
than				
whistling				
through				
the				
woods				
and				
striking				
other				
people

The				
problems

arise				
when

in

out

The

'

to				
appeal				
the

shows				
how				
perilous				
their

the

The				
decision

hearing				
`				
`				
is				
effectively				
a

order				
denying

`

the

But				
the

a

even				
then				
,				
the

are				
enormous

will				
have

three				
arguments

be				
raised				
by

:				
There

the				
particular				
issues				
that				
they				
brought				
to				
the				
court				
last				
week				
are				
really				
not				
very				
relevant				
anymore				
.				
				
They				
are				
going				
to				
probably				
,				
well				
,				
I				
know				
what				
they				
are				
going				
to				
do				
.				
				
They				
are				
going				
to				
try				
to				
broaden				
the				
case				
to				
make				
it				
a				
kind				
of				
a				
general				
referendum				
on				
election				
procedures				
.				
				
So				
,				
they				
are				
looking				
for				
a				
coronation				
.				
				
And				
the				
Gore				Al_Gore
people				
at				
this				
point				
just				
want				
to				
get				
rid				
of				
this				
case				
,				
because				
they				
think				
they				
have				
a				
better				
chance				
in				
the				
Florida				Florida
courts				
.				
				
Republicans				Republican_Party_(United_States)
generally				
support				
states				
'				
rights				
.				
				
So				
,				
does				
it				
appear				
somewhat				
ironic				
that				
they				
are				
going				
to				
the				
Supreme				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
Court				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
in				
this				
instance				
?				
				
No				
,				
I				
think				
first				
of				
all				
the				
notion				
that				
Republicans				Republican_Party_(United_States)
favor				
states				
'				
rights				
and				
Democrats				Democratic_Party_(United_States)
oppose				
it				
,				
is				
much				
too				
simplistic				
.				
				
That				
'				
s				
generally				
true				
,				
but				
it				
'				
s				
only				
true				
on				
some				
issues				
.				
				
And				
in				
this				
case				
,				
you				
could				
argue				
that				
the				
Bush				George_W._Bush
people				
are				
going				
to				
the				
Supreme				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
Court				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
to				
preserve				
the				
right				
of				
Florida				Florida
,				
to				
determine				
its				
own				
electors				
.				
				
So				
,				
there				
is				
a				
kind				
of				
states				
'				
rights				
issue				
there				
.				
				
But				
they				
need				
,				
or				
at				
least				
they				
once				
thought				
they				
needed				
the				
Supreme				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
Court				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
to				
endorse				
it				
.				
				
So				
it				
goes				
both				
ways				
.				
				
What				
are				
the				
justices				
likely				
looking				
for				
?				
				
Well				
,				
I				
don				
'				
t				
know				
.				
				
But				
I				
think				
that				
-				
and				
I				
think				
they				
will				
be				
divided				
,				
I				
mean				
I				
don				
'				
t				
think				
they				
will				
be				
unanimous				
.				
				
Obviously				
,				
they				
would				
like				
to				
be				
able				
to				
achieve				
some				
kind				
of				
resolution				
of				
the				
case				
.				
				
American				United_States
election				
laws				
are				
often				
challenged				
at				
the				
local				
level				
and				
sometimes				
in				
the				
Federal				Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States
courts				Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States
,				
but				
this				
is				
certainly				
the				
first				
time				
we				
have				
had				
a				
Supreme				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
Court				Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States
challenge				
over				
presidential				
election				
.				
				
So				
,				
there				
is				
a				
lot				
of				
new				
law				
here				
to				
be				
made				
or				
at				
least				
law				
that				
hasn				
'				
t				
been				
made				
yet				
.				
				
It				
'				
s				
possible				
that				
if				
the				
court				
accepts				
the				
invitation				
of				
the				
Bush				George_W._Bush
campaign				
,				
at				
least				
as				
it				
is				
expressed				
in				
the				
briefs				
they				
submitted				
yesterday				
,				
that				
the				
court				
will				
in				
the				
sense				
,				
take				
the				
entire				
issue				
,				
even				
-				
not				
just				
the				
specific				
questions				
that				
it				
was				
asked				
last				
week				
and				
try				
to				
resolve				
the				
question				
.				
				
For				
example				
,				
if				
the				
court				
says				
it				
is				
clearly				
the				
fact				
that				
the				
legislature	B	legislature	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Legislature	
of				
the				
state				
of				
Florida				Florida
can				
determine				
for				
itself				
who				
its				
electors				
will				
be				
,				
that				
will				
pretty				
much				
end				
the				
case				
,				
because				
that				
'				
s				
what				
the				
legislature				
already				
plans				
to				
do				
.				
				
And				
that				
doesn				
'				
t				
mean				
the				
Gore				Al_Gore
people				
won				
'				
t				
keep				
trying				
,				
because				
ultimately				
Congress	B	Congress	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress	United_States_Congress
has				
to				
decide				
and				
only				
Congress				United_States_Congress
can				
decide				
if				
there				
are				
competing				
slates				
of				
electors				
submitted				
,				
which				
slate				
to				
accept				
.
