)				
.				
				
				
Radio				
surgery				
is				
a				
modern				
technique				
which				
does				
n't				
require				
surgery				
in				
order				
to				
remove

which

.				
				
				
With				
this				
new				
technology				
,				
doctors				
are				
able				
to				
removal				
cancerous				
tissues				
embedded				
deep				
inside				
the				
brain				
or				
near				
sensitive				
organs				
that				
makes				
normal				
surgery				
very				
difficult				
and				
risky				
.				
With				
radio				
surgery				
,				
every				
step				
is				
controlled				
by				
computers				
and				
patients				
are				
conscious	B	conscious	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness	
while				
they				
undergo				
treatment				
.				
				
				
This				
new				
technique				
is				
also				
capable				
of				
treating				
diseases				
such				
as				
Artero				
Venous				
Malformation	B	Malformation	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder

or

)				
.				
So				
far				
,				
ninety				
per				
cent				
of				
the				
radio				
surgery				
treatments				
have				
been				
successful				
and				
patients				
only				
have				
to				
remain				
in				
hospital				
for				
three				
days				
.				
Additionally				
,				
there				
is				
no				
need				
for				
patients				
to				
shave				
their				
heads				
and				
radio				
surgery				
causes				
no				
scar				
,				
little				
blood				
loss				
and				
is				
not				
expensive.For
