Unfortunately				
,				
since				
I				
was				
the				
one				
holding				
the				
microphone				
,				
this				
year				
’				
s				
resolution				
seems				
painfully				
clear				
:				
Cut				
back				
on				
the				
alcohol				
intake				
.				
				
Not				
that				
I				
drink				
a				
lot				
—				
usually				
just				
a				
glass				
of				
wine				
with				
dinner				
,				
if				
that				
—				
but				
I				
’				
ve				
read				
that				
even				
one				
drink				
a				
day				
can				
adversely				
affect				
my				
health				
.				
				
Also				
,				
a				
recent				
study				
by				
the				
Mayo	B	Mayo_Clinic	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic	
Clinic	I	Mayo_Clinic	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic	
found				
that				
women				
’				
s				
bodies				
are				
less				
adept				
at				
breaking				
down				
alcohol				
than				
men				
’				
s				
.				
				
As				
a				
result				
,				
the				
more				
we				
drink				
,				
the				
more				
we				
risk				
heart				
disease				
,				
cancer				
,				
cirrhosis				
of				
the				
liver				
,				
and				
,				
perhaps				
the				
most				
chilling				
side				
effect				
of				
all				
—				
kissing				
our				
skinny				
jeans				
goodbye				
forever				
.				
				
But				
how				
much				
alcohol				
is				
too				
much				
?				
There				
’				
s				
the				
rub				
.				
The				
answer				
seems				
to				
depend				
on				
which				
study				
you				
read				
.				
				
The				
Mayo	B	Mayo_Clinic	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic	
Clinic	I	Mayo_Clinic	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic

says				
one				
drink				
a				
day				
is				
OK				
for				
“				
younger				
women				
who				
aren				
’				
t				
planning				
a				
pregnancy				
”				
and				
that				
“				
postmenopausal				
women				
should				
limit				
themselves				
to				
less				
.				
”				
				
But				
what				
about				
those				
of				
us				
who				
don				
’				
t				
fit				
in				
either				
category				
?				
				
Looking				
for				
a				
definitive				
answer				
,				
I				
turned				
to				
another				
study				
,				
this				
one				
conducted				
by				
a				
group				
of				
doctors				
at

But				
their				
finding				
that				
drinking				
three				
glasses				
of				
red				
wine				
a				
week				
reduces				
the				
risk				
of				
colorectal				
cancer				
only				
confused				
matters				
further				
.				
				
Who				
to				
believe				
?				
				
Should				
I				
cut				
back				
on				
alcohol				
entirely				
in				
order				
to				
fend				
off				
heart				
disease				
,				
liver				
problems				
and				
dreaded				
weight				
gain				
(				
not				
to				
mention				
potential				
blackmail				
opportunities				
by				
family				
,				
friends				
and				
co				
-				
workers				
)				
or				
suck				
down				
three				
or				
more				
glasses				
a				
week				
to				
keep				
the				
colorectal				
cancer				
at				
bay				
?				
				
Or				
should				
I				
listen				
to				
the				
doctors				
the				
Goteborg	B	Goteborg_University	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goteborg_University

who				
found				
that				
mice				
that				
had				
ingested				
low				
levels				
of				
alcohol				
on				
a				
daily				
basis				
showed				
a				
significantly				
lower				
risk				
of				
developing				
rheumatoid				
arthritis				
than				
mice				
that				
just				
drank				
water				
.				
				
Obsessed				
,				
I				
started				
digging				
through				
medical				
journals				
and				
online				
health				
stories				
until				
the				
studies				
began				
to				
stack				
up

a				
study				
showed				
that				
drinking				
moderately				
(				
such				
as				
a				
couple				
of				
drinks				
a				
day				
)				
improved				
the				
memories				
of

declared				
that

hindered

success				
.				
				
Live				
longer				
so				
you				
can				
die				
young				
				
Adding				
it				
all				
up				
,				
it				
seems				
that				
by				
drinking				
alcohol				
I				
can				
both				
reduce				
my				
chances				
of				
heart				
disease				
and				
increase				
my				
risk				
for				
high				
blood				
pressure				
,				
fend				
off				
dementia				
while				
upping				
my				
chances				
for				
brain				
damage				
,				
boost				
my				
memory				
at				
the				
same				
time				
that				
I				
become				
more				
stupid				
,				
avoid				
lymphoma				
while				
veering				
towards				
breast				
and				
liver				
cancer				
,				
and				
in				
general				
,				
both				
live				
longer				
and				
die				
younger

In

alcohol				
is

taking

altogether

of				
squelching
