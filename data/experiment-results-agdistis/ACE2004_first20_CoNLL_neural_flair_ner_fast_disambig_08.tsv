The

asked

The

this				
is				
considered

be

uncovered

The				
Chinese				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences
researchers				
said				
the				
feathers				
have				
some				
of				
the				
characteristics				
of				
modern				
feathers				
,				
but				
the				
structure				
is				
more				
primitive				
than				
feathers				
found				
on				
Archaeopteryx				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/Archaeopteryx
,				
the				
earliest				
known				
bird				
.				
				
Archaeopteryx				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/Archaeopteryx
appeared				
about				
145				
million				
years				
ago				
,				
while				
Protopteryx				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protopteryx
was				
dated				
as				
more				
recent				
,				
about				
120				
million				
years

Microraptor				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microraptor

which				
was				
about				
the				
size				
of				
a				
crow				
,				
lived				
about				
125				
million				
years				
ago				
.				
				
Some				
elements				
of				
the				
Protopteryx				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protopteryx
wing				
bone				
and				
muscle				
structure				
match				
those				
of				
modern

said				
Zhang				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/Zhang
and				
Zhou				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/Zhou
,				
but				
the				
wing				
retains				
a				
claw				
found				
on				
some				
primitive				
birdlike				
animals				
.				
In				
modern				
birds				
,				
that				
claw				
has				
disappeared				
and				
been				
replaced				
with				
a				
structure				
that				
adds				
lift				
to				
the				
wing				
.				
				
Nonetheless				
,				
Protopteryx				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protopteryx
is				
thought				
to				
have				
been

competent				
flier

Most				
dinosaur				
researchers				
believe				
birds				
evolved				
150

180				
million				
years

from				
a				
dinosaur				
group				
called				
Theropods				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/Theropods

cite				
fundamental				
skeleton				
similarities				
to				
support				
the				
theory

The				
evolution				
of				
feathers				
,				
however				
,				
has				
been				
less				
clear				
.				
				
Some				
experts				
believe				
feathers				
evolved				
specifically				
to				
support				
flight				
,				
while				
others				
say				
feathers				
evolved				
first				
to				
provide				
warmth				
or				
protection				
from				
water				
.				
				
Fossils				
of				
three				
theropods				
bear				
hairlike				
images				
that				
some				
say				
could				
be				
the				
early				
precursors				
to				
feathers				
.				
				
But				
Feduccia				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Feduccia
dismisses				
the				
theropod				
hair				
as				
`				
`

and				
cites				
the				
Zhang				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/Zhang

type

interoperability				
,				
but				
first				
needs				
to				
protect				
consumer

security

prevent				
the				
kinds				
of				
problems				
that				
have				
emerged

Company				
officials				
disagreed				
that				
AOL				http://dbpedia.org/resource/AOL
'				
s				
market				
share				
was				
keeping				
out				
competitors				
.				
				
AOL				http://dbpedia.org/resource/AOL
executives				
cited				
a				
recent				
study				
by				
Media				http://dbpedia.org/resource/ComScore
Metrix				http://dbpedia.org/resource/ComScore
indicating				
that				
the				
messaging				
services				
offered				
by				
Yahoo				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/Yahoo

and				
Microsoft				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microsoft
are				
the				
fastest				
growing				
in				
the				
United				http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States

Why				
all				
the

over				
a

product				
that

even

Some				
pointed				
to				
the				
recent				
demise				
of				
two				
instant				
messaging				
competitors				
_				
iCAST				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/iCAST
and				
Tribal				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/TribalVoice
Voice				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/TribalVoice
_				
as				
evidence				
that				
AOL				http://dbpedia.org/resource/AOL
'				
s				
dominance				
could				
prevent				
choices				
in				
the				
market				
.				
				
Another				
concern				
is				
that				
AOL				http://dbpedia.org/resource/AOL
could				
use				
its				
substantial				
customer				
base				
to				
tack				
on				
new				
advanced				
services				
and				
then				
charge				
for				
them

Rivals				
said				
the				
ability				
of				
various				
services				
to				
work				
together				
will				
become				
increasingly				
important				
in				
the				
future

For				
example				
,				
as

However				
,				
using

as				
fuel				
for				
joint				
circulatory				
electricity

has				
advantages				
of				
higher				
power				
generation

lower

,				
is

According				
to				
presentations				
,				
with				
this				
type				
of				
electricity				
generation				
method				
,				
a				
single				
engine				
with				
liquefied				
natural

can				
produce				
waste				
gas				
with				
temperatures				
being				
as				
high				
as				
500				
to				
600				
degrees				
centigrade				
.				
				
This				
gas				
in				
turn				
can				
heat				
a				
boiler				
for				
the				
production				
of				
steam				
to				
turn				
a				
steam				
turbine				
which				
generates				
electricity				
.				
				
Because				
of				
the				
efficiency				
of				
this				
construction				
method				
,				
the				
electricity				
generated				
is				
relatively				
competitive				
in				
price				
.				
At				
the				
same				
time				
,				
using				
natural				
gas				
as

will				
also				
reduce

is				
the

This				
summer				
,				
after				
apparently				
riding				
ocean

they				
concentrated				
themselves

the

were				
spawning				
prodigiously

broadcasting				
millions

In

4.2

the				
region				
could				
improve

One

Robinson				http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Robinson_(drummer)

the				
main				
question				
facing

The

of				
hiding

He				
says				
that				
in

probably				
felt

circumstances				
were				
such				
that				
they				
had				
no				
real				
alternative				
but				
to				
take				
the				
case				
.				
				
Well				
,				
I				
think				
they				
took				
the				
case				
because				
it				
seemed				
like				
it				
was				
such				
a				
important				
issue				
that				
it				
would				
be				
kind				
of				
unseemly				
for

tomorrow				
,				
is				
going				
to				
ask				
the				
court				
to				
hold				
the				
case				
,				
moot				
and				
dismiss				
it				
.				
				
And				
the				
Bush				http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_W._Bush
campaign				
has				
brought				
the				
case				
,				
but				
recognizes				
that				
the				
particular				
issues				
that				
they				
brought				
to				
the				
court				
last				
week				
are				
really				
not				
very				
relevant				
anymore				
.				
				
They				
are				
going				
to				
probably				
,				
well				
,				
I				
know				
what				
they				
are				
going				
to				
do				
.				
				
They				
are				
going				
to				
try				
to				
broaden				
the				
case				
to				
make				
it				
a				
kind				
of				
a				
general				
referendum				
on				
election				
procedures				
.				
				
So				
,				
they				
are				
looking				
for				
a				
coronation				
.				
				
And				
the				
Gore				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Gore
people				
at				
this				
point				
just				
want				
to				
get				
rid				
of				
this				
case				
,				
because				
they				
think				
they				
have				
a				
better				
chance				
in				
the				
Florida				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida
courts				
.				
				
Republicans				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republican_Party_(United_States)
generally				
support				
states				
'				
rights				
.				
				
So				
,				
does				
it				
appear				
somewhat				
ironic				
that				
they				
are				
going				
to				
the				
Supreme				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
Court				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
in				
this				
instance				
?				
				
No				
,				
I				
think				
first				
of				
all				
the				
notion				
that				
Republicans				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republican_Party_(United_States)
favor				
states				
'				
rights				
and				
Democrats				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democratic_Party_(United_States)
oppose				
it				
,				
is				
much				
too				
simplistic				
.				
				
That				
'				
s				
generally				
true				
,				
but				
it				
'				
s				
only				
true				
on				
some				
issues				
.				
				
And				
in				
this				
case				
,				
you				
could				
argue				
that				
the				
Bush				http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_W._Bush
people				
are				
going				
to				
the				
Supreme				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
Court				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
to				
preserve				
the				
right				
of				
Florida				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida
,				
to				
determine				
its				
own				
electors				
.				
				
So				
,				
there				
is				
a				
kind				
of				
states				
'				
rights				
issue				
there				
.				
				
But				
they				
need				
,				
or				
at				
least				
they				
once				
thought				
they				
needed				
the				
Supreme				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
Court				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
to				
endorse				
it				
.				
				
So				
it				
goes				
both				
ways				
.				
				
What				
are				
the				
justices				
likely				
looking				
for				
?				
				
Well				
,				
I				
don				
'				
t				
know				
.				
				
But				
I				
think				
that				
-				
and				
I				
think				
they				
will				
be				
divided				
,				
I				
mean				
I				
don				
'				
t				
think				
they				
will				
be				
unanimous				
.				
				
Obviously				
,				
they				
would				
like				
to				
be				
able				
to				
achieve				
some				
kind				
of				
resolution				
of				
the				
case				
.				
				
American				http://dbpedia.org/resource/American_McGee
election				
laws				
are				
often				
challenged				
at				
the				
local				
level				
and				
sometimes				
in				
the				
Federal				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/Federal
courts				
,				
but				
this				
is				
certainly				
the				
first				
time				
we				
have				
had				
a				
Supreme				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
Court				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
challenge				
over				
presidential				
election				
.				
				
So				
,				
there				
is				
a				
lot				
of				
new				
law				
here				
to				
be				
made				
or				
at				
least				
law				
that				
hasn				
'				
t				
been				
made				
yet				
.				
				
It				
'				
s				
possible				
that				
if				
the				
court				
accepts				
the				
invitation				
of				
the				
Bush				http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_W._Bush
campaign				
,				
at				
least				
as				
it				
is				
expressed				
in				
the				
briefs				
they				
submitted				
yesterday				
,				
that				
the				
court				
will				
in				
the				
sense				
,				
take				
the				
entire				
issue				
,				
even				
-				
not				
just				
the				
specific				
questions				
that				
it				
was				
asked				
last				
week				
and				
try				
to				
resolve				
the				
question				
.				
				
For				
example				
,				
if				
the				
court				
says				
it				
is				
clearly				
the				
fact				
that				
the				
legislature	B	legislature	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Legislature	
of				
the				
state				
of				
Florida				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida
can				
determine				
for				
itself				
who				
its				
electors				
will				
be				
,				
that				
will				
pretty				
much				
end				
the				
case				
,				
because				
that				
'				
s				
what				
the				
legislature				
already				
plans				
to				
do				
.				
				
And				
that				
doesn				
'				
t				
mean				
the				
Gore				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Gore
people				
won				
'				
t				
keep				
trying				
,				
because				
ultimately				
Congress	B	Congress	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congress
has				
to				
decide				
and				
only				
Congress				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congress
can				
decide				
if				
there				
are				
competing				
slates				
of				
electors				
submitted				
,				
which				
slate				
to				
accept
