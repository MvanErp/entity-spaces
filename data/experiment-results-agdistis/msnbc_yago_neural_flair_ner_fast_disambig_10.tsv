this

's				
resolution				
seems				
painfully				
clear				
:				
Cut				
back				
on				
the				
alcohol				
intake				
.				
				
Not				
that				
I				
drink				
a				
lot				
--				
usually				
just				
a				
glass				
of				
wine				
with				
dinner				
,				
if				
that				
but				
I				
've				
read				
that				
even				
one				
drink				
a				
day				
can				
adversely				
affect				
my				
health				
.				
				
Also				
,				
a				
recent				
study

found				
that				
women				
's				
bodies				
are				
less				
adept				
at				
breaking				
down				
alcohol				
than				
men				
's				
.				
As				
a				
result				
,				
the				
more				
we				
drink				
,				
the				
more				
we				
risk				
heart				
disease				
,				
cancer				
,				
cirrhosis				
of				
the				
liver				
,				
and				
,				
perhaps				
the				
most				
chilling				
side				
effect				
of				
all				
--				
kissing				
our				
skinny				
jeans				
goodbye				
forever				
.				
				
But				
how				
much				
alcohol				
is				
too				
much				
?				
There				
's				
the				
rub				
.				
The				
answer				
seems				
to				
depend				
on				
which				
study				
you				
read

a

is				
OK				
for				
``				
younger				
women

are				
n't

and				
that				
``

''				
But				
what				
about				
those				
of				
us				
who				
do				
n't				
fit				
in				
either				
category				
?				
				
Looking				
for				
a				
definitive				
answer				
,				
I				
turned				
to				
another				
study				
,				
this				
one				
conducted				
by

.				
But				
their				
finding				
that				
drinking				
three				
glasses				
of				
red				
wine				
a				
week				
reduces				
the				
risk				
of				
colorectal				
cancer				
only				
confused				
matters				
further				
.				
				
Who				
to				
believe				
?				
				
Should				
I				
cut				
back				
on				
alcohol				
entirely				
in				
order				
to				
fend				
off				
heart				
disease				
,				
liver				
problems

dreaded				
weight				
gain				
(				
not

mention				
potential				
blackmail				
opportunities

or				
suck				
down				
three				
or				
more				
glasses				
a				
week				
to				
keep				
the				
colorectal				
cancer				
at				
bay				
?

should

listen				
to				
the

both				
reduce

increase
