In

that

grow				
4.2

the				
growth

could				
be				
lower				
,				
though				
he				
would				
not				
say				
by				
how				
much				
.				
A				
principal				
culprit				
of				
possibly				
slower				
growth				
is				
the				
dependence				
of				
many				
Asian				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/Asian
countries				
on				
imported				
oil				
.				
Oil				
prices				
have				
risen

economic

Asia				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/Asia
has				
little				
control				
over				
oil				
,				
but				
Robinson				http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Robinson_(drummer)
said				
the				
region				
could				
improve				
its				
economic				
prospects

calming				
its				
political				
waters

One				
bright				
spot

China				http://dbpedia.org/resource/China

track				
to				
record				
8				
percent				
growth				
in				
2000				
.				
Robinson				http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Robinson_(drummer)
said				
the				
main				
question				
facing				
Chinese				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sinitic_languages
leaders				
was				
whether				
they				
need				
to				
spend				
billions

further				
stimulate				
an				
economy

Robinson				http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Robinson_(drummer)

Coal

a

This

At

such				
that

had				
no

but				
to				
take				
the				
case				
.				
Well				
,				
I				
think				
they				
took				
the				
case				
because				
it				
seemed				
like				
it				
was				
such				
a				
important				
issue				
that				
it				
would

who

for

tomorrow				
,				
is				
going				
to				
ask				
the				
court				
to				
hold				
the				
case				
,				
moot				
and				
dismiss				
it				
.				
And				
the				
Bush				http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_W._Bush
campaign				
has				
brought				
the				
case				
,				
but				
recognizes				
that				
the				
particular				
issues				
that				
they				
brought				
to				
the				
court				
last				
week				
are				
really				
not				
very				
relevant				
anymore				
.				
They				
are				
going				
to				
probably				
,				
well				
,				
I				
know				
what				
they				
are				
going				
to				
do				
.				
They				
are				
going				
to				
try				
to				
broaden				
the				
case				
to				
make				
it				
a				
kind				
of				
a				
general				
referendum				
on				
election				
procedures				
.				
So				
,				
they				
are				
looking				
for				
a				
coronation				
.				
And				
the				
Gore				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Gore
people				
at				
this				
point				
just				
want				
to				
get				
rid				
of				
this				
case				
,				
because				
they				
think				
they				
have				
a				
better				
chance				
in				
the				
Florida				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida
courts				
.				
Republicans				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republican_Party_(United_States)
generally				
support				
states				
'				
rights				
.				
So				
,				
does				
it				
appear				
somewhat				
ironic				
that				
they				
are				
going				
to				
the				
Supreme				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
Court				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
in				
this				
instance				
?				
No				
,				
I				
think				
first				
of				
all				
the				
notion				
that				
Republicans				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republican_Party_(United_States)
favor				
states				
'				
rights				
and				
Democrats				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democratic_Party_(United_States)
oppose				
it				
,				
is				
much				
too				
simplistic				
.				
That				
's				
generally				
true				
,				
but				
it				
's				
only				
true				
on				
some				
issues				
.				
And				
in				
this				
case				
,				
you				
could				
argue				
that				
the				
Bush				http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_W._Bush
people				
are				
going				
to				
the				
Supreme				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
Court				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
to				
preserve				
the				
right				
of				
Florida				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida
,				
to				
determine				
its				
own				
electors				
.				
So				
,				
there				
is				
a				
kind				
of				
states				
'				
rights				
issue				
there				
.				
But				
they				
need				
,				
or				
at				
least				
they				
once				
thought				
they				
needed				
the				
Supreme				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
Court				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
to				
endorse				
it				
.				
So				
it				
goes				
both				
ways				
.				
What				
are				
the				
justices				
likely				
looking				
for				
?				
Well				
,				
I				
do				
n't				
know				
.				
But				
I				
think				
that				
-				
and				
I				
think				
they				
will				
be				
divided				
,				
I				
mean				
I				
do				
n't				
think				
they				
will				
be				
unanimous				
.				
Obviously				
,				
they				
would				
like				
to				
be				
able				
to				
achieve				
some				
kind				
of				
resolution				
of				
the				
case				
.				
American				http://dbpedia.org/resource/American_McGee
election				
laws				
are				
often				
challenged				
at				
the				
local				
level				
and				
sometimes				
in				
the				
Federal				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/Federal
courts				
,				
but				
this				
is				
certainly				
the				
first				
time				
we				
have				
had				
a				
Supreme				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
Court				http://aksw.org/notInWiki/SupremeCourt
challenge				
over				
presidential				
election				
.				
So				
,				
there				
is				
a				
lot				
of				
new				
law				
here				
to				
be				
made				
or				
at				
least				
law				
that				
has				
n't				
been				
made				
yet				
.				
It				
's				
possible				
that				
if				
the				
court				
accepts				
the				
invitation				
of				
the				
Bush				http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_W._Bush
campaign				
,				
at				
least				
as				
it				
is				
expressed				
in				
the				
briefs				
they				
submitted				
yesterday				
,				
that				
the				
court				
will				
in				
the				
sense				
,				
take				
the				
entire				
issue				
,				
even				
-				
not				
just				
the				
specific				
questions				
that				
it				
was				
asked				
last				
week				
and				
try				
to				
resolve				
the				
question				
.				
For				
example				
,				
if				
the				
court				
says				
it				
is				
clearly				
the				
fact				
that				
the				
legislature	B	legislature	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Legislature	
of				
the				
state				
of				
Florida				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida
can				
determine				
for				
itself				
who				
its				
electors				
will				
be				
,				
that				
will				
pretty				
much				
end				
the				
case				
,				
because				
that				
's				
what				
the				
legislature				
already				
plans				
to				
do				
.				
And				
that				
does				
n't				
mean				
the				
Gore				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Gore
people				
wo				
n't				
keep				
trying				
,				
because				
ultimately				
Congress	B	Congress	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congress
has				
to				
decide				
and				
only				
Congress				http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congress
can				
decide				
if				
there				
are				
competing				
slates				
of				
electors				
submitted				
,				
which				
slate				
to				
accept
